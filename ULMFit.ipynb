Hi, I\\'m trying to do check-in but the website is not working. I tried 3 different browsers and the problem continues - the passenger in 7D, Flt 338 that assaulted me shouldn\\'t have flown. I trust he\\'s banned. Crew filed report to current bug on website shows ‘select departure city’ when selecting destination city luggage was severely dented/missing wheel coming off baggage claim in SAN. Luggage agent Miranda (I think) wasn\\'t any help. requested window seat and confirmed window but got stuck in middle seat.

I\\'m trying to check into my 10:50AM CT flight tmm on the desktop website and it\\'s not working (some sort of caching bug) SOS Do you guys know your check-in links from emails are broken? lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I\\'m calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff The Flight Booking Problems section of your website seems to be broken on Chrome. Might wanna look into that. Looks like a broken link for your assets the manage itinerary section of your website seems to be broken for me can\\'t check in, your site looks like this every time it loads Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. WTF is happening in PDX Late Flight March such that one way from SFO is ~$550? my luggage is gone. I\\'ve filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage. I requested a mileage challenge for status several weeks ago online but haven\\'t heard back. How do I get help with this? Just trying to book tickets to NYC and facing super fun broken styling. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll keep trying :) Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly 😥 trying to check-in...but looks like your site is down? spending my birthday night with you, DAL-DCA. Get me home! Sent a couple messages to the email you provided but to no avail. Will try again next year. Cheers. seriously, though. will there not be direct flights from SFO-FLL in may??? It\\'s fine. Already done with my purchase. But you should try it. Just go most of the way through then go back 3 not really the experience I was hoping 4, I ws forced 2 check in a small carry on, w/ nothing but empty cabin space on board wjere is our luggage #so slow at lax I spoke with a representative that offered no solution, I am a loyal customer who flies on as well I am deeply disappointed that your birthday promo was not applied to a trip I booked mere days before I received the email what happened to direct flights from SFO-FLL? Looking in May, only see connecting #help #dontdothistome I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. on VX399 from JFK to LA - dirty plane - not up to your standards. on flight VX399 headed to LA from JFK - dirtiest VA plane I have ever been on. Sad for a great airline. your Avis rental continue button doesn\\'t work on your website to book car. Tried 4 times on phone. This sucks! delayed to10.30!! currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation? Comenity Bank is a joke! Please change. Nothing but constant problems with this bank I submitted a status match request a while back and still haven’t heard! I’m flying on Monday. Can you look / accelerate? I\\'m pulling my hair out trying to book a flight with u. Your site doesn\\'t work on iPhone or iPad.don\\'t have a computer #help Can I get some help with a support ticket? It\\'s been 15 days.... Incident: 150202-000419 Thank you! I cannot even open my laptop in seat 4C and I paid a premium for this?!! Let me out of here! I am in seat 4C and I cannot even open my laptop; and I paid extra for this seat!! FYI the info@virginamerica.com email address you say to contact in password reset emails doesn\\'t exist. Emails bounce. Status match - 2 weeks have gone by and no news.Flt next week - hope flt will count towards requirement. Cust Svc no help!!! your website sucks donkey dicks. Just thought you should know. All best. all crap channels which is why I pay to watch UK tv how come you don\\'t have an iPhone app? Still using and making me waste paper. Your back of seat entertainment system does not accept credit cards that have an apostrophe in the surname. #apostrophefail When will VX use all 6 LGA slots instead of 4 today? Adding AUS makes this less likely :( sad to learn you no longer fly SFO &gt; PHL. Hope it returns! kinda sucked my earphone jack didn\\'t work on my flight. They may want to look into that for future passengers Very poor experience. First computer problem now seat malfunction. Stuck. Missing meeting in San Diego. I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time. Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well? Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn\\'t carry them on plane or lock bag. All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row! Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1) I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I\\'ve been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes.......... Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together. Man of steel flies to more cities though...and with more frequency too. started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me. While other airlines weren\\'t Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck! Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again! As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I\\'m shocked at Virgin\\'s complete apathy toward their customers. Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer? Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)…tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees. mood lighting on point🙌 Reclining my seat, kickin up my feet💤 my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay? my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can\\'t because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either 😡 still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant\\'s trip. Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there\\'s a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :) you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so. Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock. is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade. So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can\\'t transfer the tix. Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous! if the car seat is lost should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it\\'s a necessity for my child that totally sucks my cousin worked at PHL said beginning of Feb I called United they said they would send another voucher by mail. Never got anything. #tiredofwaiting the internet is a great thing. I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner. thats weak. See ya 👋 Hey !! I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab I sure did. I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag. I\\'d like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me. See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr. After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue. why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn\\'t pull on my partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#\\'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but... How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn\\'t take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. yes, we\\'ve been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice. iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it\\'s an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child well sitting on the ground \\'on time\\' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It\\'s not a concern, I\\'ll just travel with someone else moving forward. A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable When will email address/username sign-on be available? It\\'s been a while. rude rude - Why can\\'t I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec ..I received on other flights. #united truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn\\'t even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service... My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome Shame that there\\'s no flex to tickets transfer rules. Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn\\'t enough! No. Denver said they don\\'t handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs. They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either. you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told \"we can\\'t find a supervisor.\" ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn\\'t helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me. I will not be flying you again in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I\\'m arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight. our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX. v upset with your disability \"services\". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude. thnx for quick reply but don\\'t think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today. wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who\\'s active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!! 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!! as a 1k, I\\'m always hoping for improvement. not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope? OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can\\'t find a supervisor for help. mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category. It\\'s expensive to get right . another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come. I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you 😢. I sincerely hope they can help me!! silly I\\'m flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk What is your phone number. I can\\'t find who to call about a flight reservation. well, you can\\'t fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it. why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn\\'t? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did. they helped me at the baggage service desk. Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR 12 Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm. Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my was not a guide dog! what\\'s the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn\\'t read them? (Continued) I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds! What\\'s going on with UA 236? outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours! crashed trying to check in. on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement.

I\\'m Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I\\'ve been booted off the system umpteen times. how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable? I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one. you\\'ll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it\\'s like sitting on a concrete bench. 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling but it\\'s hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse. By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it\\'s a hollow one. It\\'s obvious that you don\\'t care about me or my well-being, This isn\\'t a one time thing either! It\\'s a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect. Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you It\\'s an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine. ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this. Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR. .@united it will be because I\\'m moving to because of talk, no service I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better. what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United. I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error Yeah sorry but there\\'s always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems. but then again, maybe the would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling. so you\\'re telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff? Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived. you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice So they didn\\'t drop my bag overnight &amp; now I\\'m leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag.... I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today. not able to DM you my confirmation number I\\'ve sent the message, let me know if you got it. I\\'m not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs? very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service! we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks! common!! keep your paper work ready and don\\'t delay our flights(#1585)and meetings yep that\\'s correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn\\'t matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH sent DM to you about making my connection please let me know I\\'m grounded in Montreal with ua3659. I am missing my connection ua3417 to St. Louis. Can you help,Do you have a private jet for me? I\\'m so frustrated and nervous because of this. are the ones who make it difficult for me. I\\'m not a child. I\\'m someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off? This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you? So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn\\'t next to him? I\\'m seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :( checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted? service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that\\'s not an option. Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancée and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE. Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket? #pennypincher ok. To top things off, you\\'ve lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel maybe one day you\\'ll be the one quoted on flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously??? to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2) I hadn\\'t filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2) did bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We\\'re pretty curious #UnitedAirlines hence why I\\'ve been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage according to your DMs, I\\'m not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere. pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes.... customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can\\'t eat. it was UA flight 1001! Now I\\'m currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I\\'d have it back yesterday! just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn\\'t be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning??? completed form but doubt it\\'s any use. UA doesn\\'t care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won\\'t feel responsibility for that... nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room... ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back! thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money.. frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United. It\\'s still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew, 7 hours from now, when the plane is already here. Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk! It\\'s too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight. if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery? so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can\\'t leave! #FAIL Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required We don\\'t like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming previous 1. okay ase24766m. Find our luggage. The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online... But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing... yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!! what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do plus what about food? And taxis? you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you\\'re having a good night. Thanks. I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer. airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines Thanks; might want to fix this line: \"Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days.\" it\\'s frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket. at its worse. Can\\'t figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go! 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night hou airport. Wtf??!! Hey why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they\\'d call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they\\'re waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here. “@united: We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN” I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx good to know you will open the closed doors for \"premier passengers\" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed. yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It\\'s bullshit. If it\\'s any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights. that\\'s unfortunate. The was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it. Yes. Doesn\\'t make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn\\'t change the fact that I\\'m very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight. I\\'m constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away. seriously #fail on making strangers share a room we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today\\'s flight? agent split up my reservation? Now can\\'t Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why why would they make me share a room? tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we\\'d miss options anyway can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please? we\\'re still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please. Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at ... Going to miss my ride at help please! #HelpImStuck #United it\\'s highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear \\'call corp\\' Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let\\'s find these bags. better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible \"provide a death certificate\\' policy Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn? I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you! Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW! thanks for effing up our holidays - we\\'re missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team\\'s incompetence at agent helps the person in front of me. Finishes up with them and then walks away. The guy behind me is as shocked as I am. Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous. Not encouraged that I\\'ll have my CPAP tonight. Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies?? Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it\\'s on time again with 20 min to spare? Don\\'t say it\\'s delayed unless you\\'re sure! yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD. Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let\\'s not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable. has once again let me down. Don\\'t think I\\'ve ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period. yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement. UA938 ORD-LHR. bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet! Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack? After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich. spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked. Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave. Can you help? so that\\'s it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this! I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I\\'m asking for all 50 people to be refunded. updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don\\'t get it. How can I charge devices? was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going 5 gate changes, two delays. Even the crew thinks the airline sucks I\\'m very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures. computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That\\'s just ridiculous keep people updated! Soooo, it\\'s been 15 days and you\\'ve offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now? Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2) It\\'s taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update? That\\'s correct—I\\'ve spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2) Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers. what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas? UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful. system failure again = bad trend. Software projects are like flying an airplane; there\\'s no such thing as an emergency takeoff. lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour. however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased? comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board GRK13575M is the file reference we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot! UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably. Been trying since 1230 to file a report. I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response. Yet another reason why I\\'ll never fly with you again. here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it\\'s illegal to use a used car seat I don\\'t care that a link showed me a \"wrong\" price on your site—it\\'s your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness. He needs to get to home the 24th, they\\'re telling him it\\'ll be the 25th night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done? “@united: The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see ^JP” what\\'s the point of membership? wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime Dmed you. Thank you 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh. caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you\\'ve lost it at O\\'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating! Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag? i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help what\\'s a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday? where\\'s my damn bag?? well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!! diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it\\'s way to MSY. If you only had people that cared Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can\\'t help rebook. #friendlyskies? we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies?? landed in Boston at 9 last night. The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho. FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH. also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example. i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise. now what?!? flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That\\'s how would handle. your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver So you are inadequate by accident? boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can\\'t help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies ...and when that doesn\\'t work... searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn\\'t find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play. Earn miles but can\\'t use them. flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags. That\\'s not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag\\'s location is. still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here or has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of has said nothing. cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in and exp the worst flight ever! I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened. that is not in line with your responses here. And now I\\'m waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked. I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change your helpful agents in Club helped. I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with never heard of this? doesn\\'t charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious \"costs\" that you incur, Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I\\'m not a rookie. Read my bio. I\\'ve never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc. fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY. Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage\\'s lost and there\\'s no help but argument! should NOT sell tickets for on has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry. yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets? but if i tweet the ID number, won\\'t that reveal my home address to anyone on the web? I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere! i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse. i hope this is the last time i \"have\" to fly with you. iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472 I did... no response back this is atrocious customer service. #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why? THAT\\'S your response? Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague. is the worst airline in the world. someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management. Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry. I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited I will but right now I\\'m to angry first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to #CommunicationFail the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair I\\'m saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around I think DM would be better gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft tell the truth! you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone\\'s personal possessions &amp; you couldn\\'t care less!.... how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive.. once united\\'s service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again really? Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?! Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude. found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines. Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up last minute to board us. Many panicked people by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper. I\\'m trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted. that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine! how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter. hahaha. If they weren\\'t an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!! i think he actually did not like your screen 😃😃😃 Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?! It\\'s a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim. It is going on 2 months with no attention to this? We are very upset. my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help? #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN. Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement. Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can\\'t be placed in 2000 characters? In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER We\\'ve been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked. Can\\'t leave the Tarmac ..united\\'s gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited That\\'s real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don\\'t fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I\\'ve had over the past 6 mos. blocked me from DM\\'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can\\'t redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere. We\\'ve had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that? pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible. Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn\\'t ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out. is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I\\'ve never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass. I\\'m rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep. yes, they said it took more than an hour! those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder. Not a happy flyer. UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland. Sunday 2/22. Stay tuned for blog article from 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns Heads up We didn\\'t check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren\\'t claim #s for our 2. Other people\\'s bags? This must be a drone “@united: We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you...\" Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though. flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding English doesn’t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them. Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted. well that\\'s big of you but I don\\'t have terribly high expectations at this point. it\\'s like you\\'re trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that\\'s never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 👿 nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather. Pilot says waiting on fuel. One in ur control, one not Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I\\'ll have to stay overnight? I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired. really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again. Won\\'t change our flight. Can we go now? I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap Nope - still no one helped me. Giving up on united. #badservice when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up. I\\'d thank you - but you didn\\'t help. taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn\\'t actually helpful Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven\\'t left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse? I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles! 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence. yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight! Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day! #missedWork #clientNotHappy don\\'t see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn\\'t broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes? Thanks! I\\'ll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don\\'t like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don\\'t understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent. 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now? of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are I wasn\\'t asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit flight was scheduled for 11:56, it\\'s 1:05 and we haven\\'t moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense go to hell since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don\\'t u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights 18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations. Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO! The saga of the bag delay w/ - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned. Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I\\'ve used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable! why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse we\\'ve been here since 3am and you\\'ve Cancelled Flightled our flight twice no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396 UA5396 can wait for me. I\\'m on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap. from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I\\'m getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight is there a United gold number? I\\'ve been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help. noooooooooooooooooooooope. Oh, we are sure it\\'s not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it\\'s usually the only YYJ flight that\\'s Cancelled Flightled daily. it\\'s not getting any better. I\\'d suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi. already missed connection ugh : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft. How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help! there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info. flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We\\'re on the outdoor track for an hour - SERIOUSLY it\\'s 2015?!?! NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589. You\\'re the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no \\'unwind\\' BS. u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight. #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again you\\'re the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare what a pointless tweet. At least asked me to follow them to try and resolve that\\'s not even an apology that\\'s cool - now what? - SERIOUSLY it\\'s 2015?!?! NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589. You\\'re the ONLY airline without WiFi... b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20? ORD ABQ 3709. I can\\'t even take a walk without missing a change. Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine. your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother? and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status on an airline that\\'s unsafe? STUNNING How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation? Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane, the Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back! In 2015, United is \"unable\" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981 been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can\\'t figure it out! awesome service... NOT! You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake! last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to \"sick pilot\". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care. only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I\\'m a mileage plus card member 😔 We\\'re hoping to hear from you actually. shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for \"maintenance\" it could be the same issue 2day It\\'s the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what\\'s going on other than \"maintenance\". b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best. The problem isn\\'t a Cancelled Flightled a flight. a) she\\'s an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out. sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven\\'t. gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight board I\\'d say most of the public can\\'t extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can\\'t honor? Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. \"No crew\".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to \"get to NY to catch to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead. Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don\\'t believe verbal or written confirmations from United Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don\\'t have an electronic ticket 1.75 hour delay. Nothing says sorry like a voucher. Missing time with family. #family #precioustime has two whole people trying to schedule a flight\\'s worth of missed connections. Shameful is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt gate agent at EWR \" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it\\'s time to board, please step\". STEP UP??? Lol it won\\'t help...been there done that. forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over 3 hours to rebook but 8 hours l8r the same problem again. Arrive at gate stopped cause now infant is sitting in 4 yr old lap arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt. and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too? ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter\\'s flt?? What\\'s going on? Follow me so I can dm details. Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again). was that English? I\\'ll DM though I don\\'t think you\\'ll make a plane appear. looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? Air why don\\'t you fly to SBA? 😭 sitting in a plane with no pilot. Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we\\'re very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h? received hotel but no food. Also email for 3750 miles. Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation? Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I\\'ve already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!! my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting! Ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once. switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!! #UnitedAirlines how long will1531 be delayed. Why isn\\'t the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? knows better.. i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help! you suck. 9 hour delay?! you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down. JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes. 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed! Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn\\'t police the overhead bins? Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won\\'t be able take wet clothes to the airport AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN\\'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER! still no response?? should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me There is no \"reference number.\" Your agent told me to \"just drive to the airport\" because \"I can\\'t reach anyone there to deliver...\" Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops. My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you. my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed? 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives? is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, you\\'re not that bad! I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!! I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr? no they aren\\'t - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines) need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants. space. Doctors\\' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united \\'s new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead epic fail. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac! thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule... 2nd flight in two weeks that you have lost my bag! Taking my 1K status to #neveragain #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE UA1130 Flight was a nightmare!! From poor customer service,having my confirmed seat given away.... +more issues Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone. Beyond frustrated Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover. Of course only seats are $$++. Cust svc no help working with Lisa J at ORD. she\\'s working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR. i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I\\'m still irritated w/ united. flight Cancelled Flightled, and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I\\'d be fine with DCA or IAD, just arriving earlier! Help! so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking? I am not finding the humor. at this point I made it home on my own. I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go. J you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I\\'m at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place. it wasn\\'t a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that\\'s it! We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR how about starting without the robotic response? You can\\'t control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here. Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I\\'ve ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck. yes, but it\\'s not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500 I\\'m on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son. #terribleservice #NoService as a freq flyer it makes me sad to see cust needing assistance treated so poorly. #ServiceFail day 3 of this Saga maybe they\\'ll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice No, thanks. I\\'m sick of your company\\'s lousy excuse for customer service. I\\'m never flying United again. current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online? I understand ppl make mistakes but don\\'t code something in a way that we can\\'t get reimbursed when it\\'s YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection. jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it\\'s our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy .@united Not what\\'s been shared by the pilot with passengers! WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat? WTF. they\\'re not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful. I\\'m not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse! wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn\\'t work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US? .@united You may \"dislike delays\" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time. #epicfail on #CX as flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco now going to Chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay I\\'m aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit Making sure your flights aren\\'t delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start. hilarious hahahahaha ya tried that already \"Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages.\" funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son wasn\\'t trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly again. you\\'ve been officially displaced by for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching! you need a bag bouncer. Get it together what is going on with United\\'s Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit? you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool. UA3388 was Cancelled Flightled not delayed. Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home. At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation. never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats... and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it\\'s fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly - it\\'s been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end? well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending. no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house I guess you have to \"follow\" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won\\'t send. Stopped flying 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked? just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage? why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to \"check in\" at counter? #fuckinlame very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight. an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff - 75% of a plane\\'s passengers boarding in your \"Premier\" groups might be an indication of a broken process. Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it\\'s totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it\\'s Cancelled Flightled, again. changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please. literally sucks Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable. this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really? really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised.... Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting? please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable it\\'s 430am and wife still doesn\\'t have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM? you are terrible. I\\'m glad you didn\\'t mean to, but it doesn\\'t excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a \\'error\\' message. I hope you didn\\'t still charge me. … But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 … Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.) on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too. aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won\\'t be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how\\'s that for patience? ual sucks not happening. Delta took care of us. Peace! BUT just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (\"uplink prob\"). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate? so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United Yes I did. We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you. Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage. after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You\\'re the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service! doesn\\'t help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight. 40 minutes on tarmac now. That\\'s after 9 hour delay. I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER????????? One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional. that\\'s why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why... that\\'s why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate also didn\\'t ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs. your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn\\'t have a gate agent once we got a gate. after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That\\'s how much they value my time?? checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving? Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don’t see that it has taken off yet thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher? If you consider 50 mins for bags 10:00pm on a Sunday night \"as fast as they can\", you should reconsider what you think that means. It\\'s the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United why do you want me to be loyal if don\\'t let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach. Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck. Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever Not to belabor my point,but shouldn\\'t I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat? Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment? even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded I\\'m desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight. #unacceptable #ORD Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip. Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn\\'t that my choice? How about all gate checked? Thx bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info. You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it! was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars will lose my bag but won\\'t give me free pretzels #frauds you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved! typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century! is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor?? customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold. was forced to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic love how you don\\'t give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I\\'ve stayed away tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error). it will be on a different airline. and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved. clicked \"upgrade now\" and it didn\\'t upgrade. What gives? you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can\\'t be book. spent over 2 hours with united support tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can\\'t be book! quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around. Flight 472 from ORD couldn\\'t let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. i need help but in spanish A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn\\'t wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them? UA1731 - Denver to Austin... Still on the ground... either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight... considering it. Currently gold on Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore? worst flights I\\'ve ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN customers aren\\'t dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi bull crap. I spent $600 on a recent trip. That\\'s not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles. Would have only been 6600 UA yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier compensate us for new clothes bet you won\\'t we\\'re stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =) yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams I tried the online tracking and they said something like \"attempting to locate luggage\" your worker told us not to call because we\\'d be talking to someone in Thailand... - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven\\'t received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here. is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground. #liars #united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus? you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections if you don\\'t like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much? the delay is due to customer service for 20 people? What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+? #FlightFail #Hour20Delay but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read \\'ya we\\'ll change that so our customers get better service\\' really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc. to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business. I can\\'t find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight? Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn\\'t address the issue! that\\'s not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed. Why is my time less important to you? #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice I did. It took about an hour and a half though Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =( WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn\\'t let us on. time to give up my 1K status and switch to - you are so terrible I can\\'t even describe. You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won\\'t let us on even though it\\'s at the gate. #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent. many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can\\'t find an empty gate? You\\'re trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant. we\\'ve been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free. Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing \"delayed due to customer service\" Huh? what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That\\'s it??? except all of that delayed the flight anyway. maybe find a different gate #ua1758 I sent a message. It\\'s very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt? wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we\\'re hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations. Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative. I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn\\'t an option. wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It\\'s now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484 not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can\\'t use their overhead space... is so cheap they couldn\\'t afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he\\'s stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O\\'Hare in Chicago. sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors. UAL is incompetent on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas? take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain\\'t cool, yo. I didn\\'t have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn\\'t going to pay for another cab to do so. didn\\'t realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow. You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I\\'d like to speak to someone about it. I\\'m really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there. so glad I\\'ve been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever. we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep. lol too little too Late Flight yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin? Pls start charging. please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins. Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief your seats are god awful. good try but got her here safer and sooner 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed! I\\'m on UA1118 and my direct tv isn\\'t working. How do I avoid this in future? is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don\\'t believe gate agent that overhead is full; don\\'t reserve aisle i sure will any options to cos tonight? Doesn\\'t look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room? Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s. customer service sucks! They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes. JP - DM message who? Can\\'t get a DM through to strikes again! Why board anyone if there\\'s something wrong with the plane? Common sense. thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21. Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting. Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD??? always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence is the airline of the Oscars but doesn\\'t carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can\\'t watch the Oscars. #united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work. I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay. I need help with a missing bag. I was. But I have given up. you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help! UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp... is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers might possibly have the worst service on the planet. deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I\\'m hoping its on there and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse I honestly couldn\\'t tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind. thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence why doesn\\'t my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow? was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse! UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy! I don\\'t know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I\\'m unable to do bc the site won\\'t let me.Seems to be ongoing How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed! CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I\\'ve been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston why do you hate your passengers? how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn\\'t anyone actually do maintenance .@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good. is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!! Fingers crossed!!! #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw. -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool! they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me. Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever. #UnitedAirlines flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!! false. sitting on the runway in Newark, they won\\'t let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. hates us all. .@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at Great job idiots. 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines you guys suck, 2 1/2 delay to get out of ers and didn\\'t even have curtesy to let me know, #UnitedAirlines Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays. seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed). what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me? been good 15yr \"friendly skies\" relationship. 2day agent told me I\\'m \"only Canadian\" and thus not good enough for military preboard yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots “@united: What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” inconvience* “@united: What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn\\'t been great. .@united I think not. I\\'m not flying you again, if I can help it. always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle. EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071 .@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it? you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD tweet bots obviously don\\'t get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people. customer service what\\'s That??? -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Returning for \\'more quick fixes\\' &amp; breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!! that\\'s what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!! Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding now this Would be nice if partner tickets that don\\'t provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off seriously what\\'s with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn\\'t go up! . 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids! Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead! no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at or the every time I search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. About to book on a different airline and Cancelled Flight my card. so the last seg of my flight from Denver (DEN) to hayden/steamboat (HDN) for 8am got Cancelled Flightled and I need help finding my luggage 8 hours Late Flightr and I\\'m siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service! We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags now let there also pls be in-flight live TV on UA469 DEN-EWR so I can watch the #Oscars ?? has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight &amp; the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status. yes I have &amp; they\\'re unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with #disappointed of course. But interesting how United doesn\\'t seem to have a good sense on what\\'s happening with flight pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately. you guys are complete ass why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT. - Plane came in with broken seat. Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids. worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight have you read your own same day travel change policy? your b737-800w literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a \"snow storm in Denver\". And now I\\'m in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+ still sucks. I don\\'t understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous \"I dunno what time you will leave today. \". Dunno?! That\\'s code for ...? has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter I\\'d rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it\\'s departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!! I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains! you could give me free flights for life, and I\\'d still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor. The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why? 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending is by far THE WORST airline I\\'ve ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I\\'ve flown to!!! It\\'s outrageous! ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now? thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime I hope you lose the next govt contract lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you! the bag is in a state that I didn\\'t travel to and the airports don\\'t fly to each other. Looks like it\\'ll never show ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not! stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor seriously? UA 806. Delayed because of the copilot isn\\'t here? For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing seriously. This is just complete bs. we\\'ve been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives? the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad! Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake ouch not fair is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don\\'t know how to value the customer I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it\\'s unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling if I miss the #Oscars I\\'ll never fly united again is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy flight delayed...again...every time. \"Maintenance issues\" yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can\\'t get their tiny TVs to work! heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn\\'t get an email. maybe don\\'t play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn\\'t working...✈️ on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information. thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ so unhelpful... I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents said their too busy. Not cool flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation - In case you\\'re reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules. is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there\\'s no overhead space. Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable. stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K.... Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I\\'m glad it\\'s free for now. pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It\\'s been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame.. agent, \"You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full.\" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks. united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren\\'t booked. Renting a car. I\\'ll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means. any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update. 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out? I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge. You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO. Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time. thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I\\'m in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren\\'t booked. Renting a car. thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight. Airlines are the absolute worst so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok. What do I do now????? ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to \\'passenger comfort\\'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would ! my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he\\'s booked me a flight you left my bag in Houston last night. It\\'s freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow. has terrible customer service &amp; doesn\\'t feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing. trying to check in for tomorrow\\'s flight. website keeps timing out. what\\'s up? yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help. Says can\\'t rebook says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The \"weather\" didn\\'t affect any other airline. #UA6136 It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers\\' rights. thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can’t fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight “@united:That\\'s not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 &amp; still not resolved Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex? - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!! I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on. Now I\\'m going to LAX instead of Hawaii. :( reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn\\'t reseated. This only happens on international itineraries line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don\\'t have time. There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations. American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service. unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a \\'missing screw\\' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good. Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn\\'t want, all while not even notifying me. Great 1K service 👎 you guys are gay the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!! Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time?? it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this? You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really? rescheduled my return flight from #Japan? Uh why? Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait. #fun is by far the worst airline ever 😡😡 no. Re-booked with American and United said they\\'d transfer our bags to them. I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better. I\\'m DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help! no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry ? I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that\\'s 7 hours you had. #fail! so many delays today...What\\'s up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should’ve had yesterday, it’s $514 today. Thanks. called back and I\\'ve been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I\\'ve paid I\\'m not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps? check in and it\\'s still saying I haven\\'t paid. I\\'ve called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn\\'t paid for it. So I called was on delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don\\'t care about our shoes. Ua649 It\\'s all about profit, and they don\\'t really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed I unfortunately didn\\'t get her name :( she was not nice! what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously? My bag is lost and I can\\'t get ahold of anyone that can help Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times! When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I\\'m told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a \"no show\" never flying United again! Worst experience ever ah, so that\\'s where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went. cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage. Please hep flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable. we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service direct messages not going through please help Adding reservation to iOS app doesn\\'t show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can\\'t be redeemed for upgrades thru your app I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What\\'s worse is plane is here but crew can\\'t fly!! Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium. Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight! hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai so what\\'s the solution? is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted? no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in. so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do.. severely under staffed at Iah. this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues once again you guys didn\\'t let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming not for me. I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax. “@united: It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH” always blame the customer not my luggage it\\'s boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR 🆖 who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don\\'t even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening? oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system. feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened? employee=faceless. Don\\'t throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I\\'m almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2 you can\\'t say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn\\'t even started! I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting DM\\'d you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag. two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn\\'t enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST! this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance. you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!! any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately. involuntarily bumped your passenger and can\\'t guarantee them another flight for three days! Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you\\'ve I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN! .@united Our newest delay, right now If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that \"really there are 3 not 4 seats\" 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out. Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad is a joke. Lots of angry people at IAH this AM. completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy) Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing? right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn\\'t this done when the planes were sitting out all night? two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don\\'t ask for extra peanuts... That\\'s NOT allowed! I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed. I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your \\'trained\\' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don\\'t you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn\\'t get changed mid-travel you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue! more lies... they wouldn\\'t let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line.. after 6 hour plus delay from #WashingtonDC finally on flight to #Edinburgh all very tired I don\\'t believe that you do.. : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever! they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn\\'t the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim. why don\\'t you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/ fuck you for not caring 😢 its been five days, I\\'m just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don\\'t want to have to take this higher up. if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST! Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home! of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable! lost my luggage from ATL to hdn luggage in denver and said will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785 If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears! Thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but... DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you! why can\\'t you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue? why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can\\'t contact! Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can\\'t speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag! I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines! I would never fly United Airlines again! I am still in the airport waiting for my flight. your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days! now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying \"think about your next flight...\" #customer #outrage did your super computer 💩 ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers - you rebooked me to UA1764 after UA 3883 was Cancelled Flightled. I paid for first class ticket - but new seat is 38E. Can you please fix! is your check-in system down? I\\'m having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs. fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better. Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to? you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta. no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay. The replacement flight leaves Late FlightR than this one was scheduled tomorrow. Not cool. overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst. On hold 2X 60 min ea. Trying to bk a tix to Asia. Your website &amp; customer service dont want my business. Korea Air it is. I would like to know what is the easiest way to get a refund. help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded? The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here your service need work - check out this Bush airport \"customer service line\" last nt #unitedagainstunited you realize you\\'ve said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed \"help\" Thanks. This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure. Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. lost bag on next flight. Didn\\'t have time to load during the 5 hour delay?Consequence from platinum to gold A day Late Flightr, one delayed &amp; one Cancelled Flightled flight, I\\'m at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting. can you not get the first flight of the day off the ground on time? #1531. Let\\'s go....... What does delayed due to Customer Service mean for UA761? wifi wasn\\'t working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel flight #1 no luck on #standby I\\'m not sure it will have \"next time\"... now the weight restriction? \\'We\\'ll try to get as many of you as we can on this plane\\' you a bish Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage. is 4:30am and I am in the customer service line trying not to scream. #epicfailunited flighted delayed for hours. 10pm arrival to Vegas is now 4am. Did you seriously lose my luggage??? 2100$ ticket,12h biz trvl,no wifi.Missed con flt,next one#24h,missed meeting,7$ food voucher,hotel chkout#12,flt#5,no wifi#hotel still missing my luggage, was promised someone would call, no call so far, flight from Shanghai to DC with connecting flight in ORD you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification? since I have an international connection at 9am, I\\'m hoping for the same thing! it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is morning already and I no longer need a hotel room once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money? you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I\\'m delayed 10 hours now. What\\'s my refund options? where is my bag?? I\\'m in Mexico about to go build a house &amp; my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M I know that. Thanks for the standard reply. you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you This has been the WORST flight experience I\\'ve ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note. hey, it\\'s 4am, guess what I\\'m doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports no my concerns were not addressed DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks oh, I\\'ll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA. *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff? Thanks for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask? you hung up on me again. your \"customer service\" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can\\'t even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?! it\\'s disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I\\'ve received tonight. of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That\\'s the ONLY reason I\\'ve been on hold for the past 5 hours! Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration. you\\'ve got to be kidding me. I still haven\\'t talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow???? .@united I wouldn\\'t describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it. and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best is that all that matters, not the fact that we\\'re at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress, 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag gee thnx. UA922 awesome job absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn\\'t there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is unreal!! nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left. averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I\\'ve gotten no help from you tonight. thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I\\'ve had to call back 4x. That\\'s 240minute wait times. you\\'re customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I\\'ve been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x. you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn\\'t let him fly is negligence. I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why? new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550 - you sure missed the mark on tonight\\'s redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better! after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets where is our luggage we just left (delayed). screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN! why don\\'t you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline... flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me. That\\'s called throwing \"loyalty\" out the window and trying to give less awards. your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I\\'m in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives?? I\\'d hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk? that\\'s not an apology. Say it. been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest? no apology? Cool. you ask a lot of customers who you routinely screw over. You know that, right? I\\'m a first time solo female traveller and it\\'s pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are... I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers.... somehow I knew that you\\'d wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain. Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100\\'s of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I\\'m trying to figure out how to get home. Cool. we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time. poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how \"wifi is coming!\" Hah.Not before I leave. ftw more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn\\'t fly 6232 to JAC. Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!? worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354 Disappointed - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting for over 1 hr look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ and then to SFO is not acceptable. Freakin\" Suck 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. 20 yrs of flying Continental/united exclusively I get why everyone hates you - fl1289sfo/EWR #getmeoffrhisFUCKINplane I\\'m still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back. screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #. 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985 YOU SUCK! yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age... how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two just DM\\'d had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :( it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent. my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this? I\\'m extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder. I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv 30 of us on flight 1750 trying to get to tel aviv that is trying to take off right now with out us so cruel. Next flight is 350pm considering I\\'m now stuck in Newark with virtually sleep in 30+ hours, I doubt it :/ hope car rentals are available Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though! do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of tomorrow morning given the storm? also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare via on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare? 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It\\'s been one mess up after another. Bad day the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food. sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards I\\'m rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat well this one missed the mark. She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don\\'t have enough flight attendants?? we\\'ve been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We\\'ve only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed please get me off this plane #UA57 have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable. our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!? your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD. #failed not completely. Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification. Wife and I have two new destinations and I\\'m stuck in DC until Monday with no bags no I don\\'t. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw can you make sure I’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it. has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business when I read it say \\' in some cases\\' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case? I\\'m trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn\\'t a hard stream. Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight why don\\'t you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don\\'t speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed. boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying it\\'s 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would \"sit awhile\" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm. had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I\\'ll never have to fly ever again .. I\\'d really like to get off of this plane now. possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding. Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive. She commented she didn\\'t care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs My contact stuff is in the bag and I\\'m legally blind. This is so messed up. Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I\\'m not going to have for how many days. 3 times I\\'ve called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can\\'t you call me back! Tell me that you\\'re at least going to cover a room and get me out of here. OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse. Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever. Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to \"Try again Late Flightr\". please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks what exactly do you hang on this hook? - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?! why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick .@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you\\'ve got your work cut out for you. It\\'s bc you treat customers like garbage. Pay for my hotel.... I\\'m a broke student #help all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help what a nightmare!! Both sides of my flights are a disaster! At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter you\\'re terrible. it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won\\'t be for days! Anyone there? Did you read my DM? EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I\\'ve EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim. it\\'s been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? trying to get a customer service agent. Just landed in SFO. Can\\'t fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!! nope I gave up - maybe they\\'ll deliver it more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications! and waiting hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow! Have a ship to board! The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts. the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight. 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I\\'m still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution is the worst still waiting thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue #customerservice at could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful. instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays. Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight. unfortunately, they didn\\'t. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would your baggage person told me to go through - they\\'re handling my connecting flight. I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing! #horribleservice #unitedsucks Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I\\'m Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for And yet we still haven\\'t left yet and I can\\'t watch my pre-paid DirectTV. #firstworldproblems yr team have me on hold for over an hour unhelpful Pls can you answer my question. .@united Let us know when you find everyone\\'s luggage. Thanks. #UnitedAirlines Nope! I\\'m on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice. Still do not have my bag, it\\'s in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm. just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help? website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs. we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed! I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I\\'m waiting at customer service. Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it! 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can\\'t leave. thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight! how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff? Reply to - Doesn\\'t do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction. 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I\\'m 1K. I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I\\'d have to pay. never again. is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren\\'t our fault. your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint. God damn fucking crew won\\'t be here till 6:40, so you\\'ve known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit. you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they\\'re short staffed sucks. I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix? is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents. quality work going on here. No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed We\\'ve let you know how to help the millions of customers you\\'ve treated like garbage. It\\'s no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline. yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent. Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious. Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call. Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline says is the final carrier . Us air doesnt have it. I want my bag!!! Not a claim not an im sorry. I want my clothes!! seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous! most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!! you have failed so uncontrollably today that it\\'s beyond repair. I\\'m beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations. A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed? I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on Have tried at least 4x. you have a culture issue rep wouldn\\'t rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days! employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service. its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather?? Backup planes?? Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help! 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I\\'m back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost i\\'m glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United u Cancelled Flighted my flight from IAD to JAX. Was supposed to use plane from BNA but u used that plane for another destination instead. 1/2 appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out? A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this? just filled it out. Hope someone responds before we book our next trip. friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don\\'t have any answers. #BadCustomerService #$10voucherwhatajoke meant changed planes - i hate seating over wing if u wanted I would have booked it - u will get formal complaint u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I\\'ve even though I have platinum and the other person none haven’t before and haven’t this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in case—nothing sloppy stuff you don\\'t see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email? no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane no wheelchairs no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance the nightmare continues... this team added 30 mins on turnaround call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer yes, I\\'ve been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me. we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!! no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct? Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. please don\\'t take my membership away :( Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning. has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn\\'t understand the concept of time zones, thanks! but your system gave my seat away.now I\\'m 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away? yep—used that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, “thank you for submitting your request” please. You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L any help is appreciated. That\\'s a LOOONG wait for help on something that\\'s not his fault my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there\\'s a 1hr wait on phone is probably the least satisfactory airline I\\'ve ever been on. Never fails to disappoint. not sure why u call it customer care. Should be customer we don\\'t care who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now. I fly normally. This doesn\\'t happen to me with them. I\\'ll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you. how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don\\'t sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It\\'s kind of like being robbed.Explain great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight. Don\\'t know how you manage to do it. the worst customer service in Denver. ruined my day &amp; start trip SFO to GIG. both legs changed, lost my paid upgrade &amp; 200 1st class seat &amp; moved me from Econ + to Econ now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, \"not with my hands!\" #badservice I need #United to be a better airline!! flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can\\'t help me Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You\\'re welcome. #badservice You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross! help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint. ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes that\\'s a crazy long form! You need something other than a video? I hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow flight just Cancelled Flightled. This is ridiculous You shouldn\\'t page o\\'head that it\\'s best to call 1-800# - on hold 26+ mins appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I\\'ll try #Delta thank you for your reply. My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait list. or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around. 4 of us are stranded And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait. hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!! Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first can\\'t get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can\\'t be looked in the eyes by anyone. nope. Called, lost the seating preference I paid for, and here I still sit. We\\'ll see what happens w/ my flight Late Flightr. stuck in DC trying to get to Denver. The engine shut down twice on us at the terminal. Got any available flights for me? yes 1427 Cancelled Flightled. Moved to 333. I\\'ll figure out car rental changes and such. troubling news, time to raise the bar on legroom! terrible travel experience. Traveled 8000 miles roundtrip but two Cancelled Flightlations of short hops cost me two days why are you charging people to see the freaking flight map? my flight from MCO has been delayed &amp; scheduled to arrive after my connection departs. What options do I have? is not a company that values it\\'s customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I\\'m not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip DAY to IAD and CVG to IAD both Cancelled Flightled by United but all other airlines operating. Friend stuck and now miss intl flight. Help? well if you don\\'t want your customers to be frustrated compensate them appropriately when you screw up royally!! #fakesincerity employees are the angriest, angst-iest group of people anywhere (except for Tasha at check-in at IAH.) But it\\'s doubtful he\\'ll fly United again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of North America Worst customer non-service for sure! Worst airline ever? Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks need assistance. Line is out the door and travelling with 3 kids. Friend at O\\'Hare and can\\'t get on flight bc they say no proof he bought 1st class tkt. He has boarding pass. Right now at Tropic Air in San Pedro, #Belize. Line out the door. All due to elected &amp; appointed hacks Your new mileage policy is awful. Before, I might have paid slightly more for United because of miles. Now there\\'s no difference. can anyone assure me that the aircraft coming to Denver had left it\\'s previous destination? Flight 3618 yes refund my ticket and give me email address to let u know what happened I would like 2 speak VP of #CustExp Jimmy Samartzis! I sent a survey/email about my awful flight exp we are delayed in San Pedro, Belize. We are scheduled to fly out at 3pm from Belize City to Houston. Will you wait please? Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me. Great! I\\'m guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you\\'re overcharging, and don\\'t care that everyone is miserable. UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE. What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) (via I\\'m on snowy roads to BWI. I Just called MileagePlus &amp; told flight was Cancelled Flighted 1 1/2 hours ago. I rcvd no notification. Pls help I interviewed yesterday as a flight attendant I was the last person the recruiter said they lost my file n came back to interview me remember in business, a pleasant experience, means you will tell a friend. A bad experience means you will tell everyone you see let me assure you my travel time is 4h2m not 5h2m #timezones #accuratetraveltimes #3rdtimethishashappened U BUMS HOW DO U LOSE THE BIGGEST BAG ON THE FLIGHT is to airlines as is to cable/internet customers ✅. Customer service ❌ great decision making skills flight ops IAH bag makes a 10 minute connection and I don\\'t, flight pushed early. Disappointed!!!! Meanwhile, they fucked my flight. The festivities are already in full swing at the United Fairway Club, overlooking the 17th hole.. in the process of purchasing ticket, when prices changed. unbelievable. #RipOffs #PriceDiscrimination although, I am stranded in Chicago O\\'Hare for another 8 hours. Any chance your cracker-jack service team could provide a meal? 14 hours after landing in #ATL &amp; I still do not have my bags...which means no clothes or makeup!!! #UnitedAirlines #nothappy #bullying in the #workforce not ok. Get gate agents 2 work as a team. 2 against 1 is never cool. #Delays #flights #UnitedAirlines really fucked my day up Hilo to LAX 2hr30min delay because of software? missed connection, getting home 8hrs Late Flightr no upgrade nothin send someone to the customer service counter in person. DIA concourse B across from gate B36a. I\\'m not sure why I expected anyone to be here this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we\\'re not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! it\\'s my 21st birthday and my sister is coming to celebrate but her flights keep Cancelled Flighting PLZ do all you can to get her here!!!! what\\'s the hold up with flight 6475 from SLC to DEN?? DEN-PHX flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted. Asked for overnight 2nite in LAX/SNA. Told not without paying. That\\'s wrong Yeah that didn\\'t happen! Why do I still not have my bags? They arrived &amp;website says they\\'re still at the airport..2 1/2 hours Late Flightr???!! #nothappy had a maintenance issue. Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won\\'t even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really. Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I\\'ve selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade! no announcement re extra baggage, \"find an empty bin\" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing bags arrived - I sure miss the customer focused days when I used to fly Here\\'s hoping wakes up Total BS.have 1st class seats for connecting flight. Your crew Late Flight. We miss connection. Had next plane. Yet u don\\'t honor it?? .@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names. once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff! Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage fuck you, and your shitty fucking information on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins I\\'m strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines your website won\\'t allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties** really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the \"inflight wifi\" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices? outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation\\'s not happening? Website wasn\\'t working. bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything. Long lines!! #ua1523 what\\'s going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days. what incentive do I have to give you another chance? Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15. Rebooked,arrived 8 hours Late Flightr. Last year 9 hrs to San Diego and the no inflight entertainment! lost bag in Huston we leave for a Bahamas cruise today from #nola and had to buy all new stuff. Customer service is non existent site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can\\'t even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time. Thanks you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A\\'dam. Let\\'s see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states. just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. I should\\'ve listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks. officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane! 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn\\'t left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left. I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response. terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I\\'m needing some help reFlight Booking Problems. I was, just very surprised it took over 15 mins. Never experienced anything like that on 1K number I\\'m afraid not... I fly or service every week and I\\'m just unhappy..spend too much money to be unhappy if you\\'re going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don\\'t stall the inevitable. your plane\\'s been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck. Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better. 15.99 for wireless? Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst! have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? your \"Airserv\" contractors aren\\'t worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity. Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement web app won\\'t let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it\\'s a pita 132 characters does not cover my reasons I\\'m afraid while busy on his cell phone ??? really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address. \"Left gate 5 minutes early.\" My thoughts: \"That doesn\\'t count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour.\" #comeonpeople on flight 1665 but it\\'s not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean? do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag, didn\\'t have to check i booked lh via ua. However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight. Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me. How do i get it coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3) I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh. never fails to have delayed flights 😡 Yes, myself and about 200 other people also. it\\'s been booked into first class with curbside delivery 24 hours from now. I\\'m counting on it! #TeamUSA is ridiculous! UA6 delayed for 3.5 hours and counting. Should have booked with a diff airline that takes it seriously #unitedsucks at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees I do I was on UA 495 LAX TO DEN - we are scheduled to land LAX 7:38 am - please rebook to Denver - best flight No first class passenger should have to pay for inflight wifi. my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks. UA 1706 there is no way a plane \"loses its software\" I believe you decided to do an upgrade... already missed connection... UA 495 typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight... UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say \"oh well\" Friend stuck in bus on runway at PEK with two small kids no customer service, no explanation, kids crying, awful service. no. U guys suck. I\\'ll never fly with u again. And ur supervisors suck too. on a flight to New York! Love the quality planes on United!! #WTF #crappy #aviation #NewYork yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer. bad customer service to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on : United\\'s CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed? : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can\\'t respond b/c she\\'s alone I was flying home for a 9:30am event tomorrow. You pushed back my flight. Now I have a $400 ticket that won\\'t get me home in time. - you delayed our departure by 2 hrs to wait for passengers from another flight that was Late Flight! Unacceptable!! flight 1136 from Chicago to Houston over 2 hours and no pretzels or peanuts?! Seriously about passed out. - after having to now TAG MY OWN bags at the airport I was hoping they would actually arrive WITH me - here\\'s hoping they arrive I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I\\'m worn out! #EnoughIsEnough so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service. your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service? She 👏 won\\'t 👏 be 👏 at 👏 my 👏 wedding 👏. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There\\'s no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this? Brothers luggage was lost on Copa Airlines Flight 635. He\\'s competing Sunday for the 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup. Please help On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy Brothers baggage was lost on route to 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup Championship in Columbia. His race is Sunday. Please help. Yes there were PLENTY of seats available. So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer? funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with \"issues\"... that would have been nice earlier today. Too Late Flight now. I hope. waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on? no still trying to get home. Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats That is not what your reservations desk just told me. They said there were plenty of seats very exasperating I\\'m having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you\\'re undergoing maintenance. Really, now? lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow no I did not make connection. Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my return. no u don\\'t how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission! sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off. to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service Stuck in this airport 12 hours in standbys cuz the pilot showed up Late Flight in PJs &amp; i missed my connectin flight. PJ\\'s I TELL U! #NYFW if I wait I\\'ll lose the flight. So frustrating. it most certainly was not. trying to book flight w/miles. Was on hold for 50m before I gave up. Need to get 6 on same flight using two diff # and pay 4 1tix THAT\\'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you\\'re not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain y not? You\\'re the reason we\\'re in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight! not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I\\'d be mortified if my employees acted as yours has time to respond to everyone else\\'s complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer \"most likely\" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks. tell me something I don\\'t know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that\\'s crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally “@united: We don\\'t like to hear this. Is there anything we can help with? Thanks. ^EY” another empty offer for help. I\\'m try to upgrade my seats to first class but the wait time on the phone is 40 minutes... can you help? UA7985 is a coshared flight w/ ANA. Unable to check in 24 hrs prior. never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best. when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at? when will I hear? Guitar was damaged in December. I use my guitar to earn a living. Get your act together! I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face! I hope so but I\\'ve received no help so far. I\\'ve been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me? tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD. how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded I miss the Continental days. or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares. It wasn\\'t full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?! Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?! Thanks for nothing. Next time I\\'ll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right? first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven\\'t pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information. have better customer service at John Wayne airport. passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn\\'t at the bar. Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What\\'s up with that??? is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I\\'m stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in. you\\'re right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok. - we\\'re sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can\\'t find captain. #ridiculous #united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced... Stuck in Houston because you can\\'t seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions. you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines. how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! I\\'m Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don\\'t care about your customers. Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you \"can\\'t do anything\" #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility. You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw you guys suck! never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot. second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting.. again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I\\'m furious right now. thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great. Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn\\'t fix it. Flight was listed on website, but \"unavailable\"to book. False advertising much? unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes \"like every 15 minutes.\" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we\\'re taking a cab. You going to reimburse? If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it? Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none. not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience. How can I file a claim when your agents won\\'t let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON\\'T find my bag I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean? I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don\\'t fly united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this. made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change. been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end? can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157 &amp; on top of no free tv on the int’l leg, now I’m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks Your \"Loyalty Team\" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google \"loyalty\" and get back to me? ^LOL Hey this is your job, don\\'t give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks if you mean beyond opaque \"maintenance issues\", yes, that would be basic in customer service which your EWR staff can\\'t manage. \"Dear Ted. We don\\'t care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United\" . sad that you don\\'t think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1) - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA! He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day! That was the problem. We were being told the aircraft was on its way. will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel! I can\\'t even make this stuff up. do you know how to use twitter bro? Your terminal looks like it\\'s in Bosnia. Here\\'s another pic. you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible. I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors. now I\\'ll probably miss my next connection! you may think I\\'m joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight. not the case. Now delayed due to \"mechanical issues with no update on departure time\". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues? Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!! I didn\\'t get a message from you. I\\'ll resend numbers. What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don\\'t mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume. You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won\\'t be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA. Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business! Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don\\'t have my bag!!! Why haven\\'t you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!! cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you\\'d like me to continue flying your airline. roundtrip to London on ? I think I will! FYI that\\'s another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies already Flight Booking Problems next week\\'s trip on thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail Also, group 5 is total BS. Don\\'t ask me to be patient without offering something in return. just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100 I will! On or all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd. - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can\\'t change. 5.5 hours Late Flightr I\\'ve been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn\\'t cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi! Yes but unbelievable. Should have a free fare lock worst AIRLINE BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/ it should be free like other airlines! Again, it’s not 1997 anymore. Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight. I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs also doesn\\'t help me. I\\'m a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing. delayed another hour Can\\'t beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight. NWS issued storm warning already... do it again! I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail don\\'t need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable. add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i’ll come back. so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays. I beg of you plz sort this out soon! super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn’t 1997! as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people! #letsgo 4016 529557. You going to transfer my car to me too? Because it\\'s at the airport you couldn\\'t get me too... next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can\\'t deliver it in a timely manner. I\\'m sorry it\\'s cold in chicago, but I don\\'t see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel. you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool. you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it\\'s changed to refreshments. Where\\'s my refund? Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we\\'ll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated we can\\'t all be american airlines I suppose... Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let\\'s make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost! You NEVER get it right. .@united It\\'s worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. \"But there are rules\" says I\\'m fully aware, it\\'s just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you\\'re going to resell my seat for more $. why I won\\'t check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always. this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated. Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution. this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all. its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn\\'t cleaned properly. I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you. thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn\\'t cleaned properly just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing I can\\'t even look at you right now. I\\'ll call you when I\\'m not so mad. I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach Nope, still sitting at the gate! the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations .@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven\\'t taken off for a 10:30 am flight Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane. thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest! Get more agents at sfo 25! That\\'s still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day. MIA-EWR #384 😄😄😄 excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 😡😡😡 No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure. your customer service is crap. thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks! UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate. Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable. No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn\\'t. kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness? Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline. fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that \"slight delay\" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation. Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can\\'t reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number. worst flight experience I\\'ve ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again. why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line? why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie hey! DM not working. UA 307! the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it\\'s like sir u r lying how can I help splitting up my flights quadruples the price contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used? after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn\\'t caused by weather what I don\\'t understand isn\\'t flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight... Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can\\'t use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous actually we aren\\'t. Still parked here. Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights? I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page, 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you\\'ve lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx! why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years. I\\'m familiar with the procedure. It wouldn\\'t be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn\\'t seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact cleaning a regional jet takes an hour? You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF? Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days your website is a complete joke when using safari! the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck. airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege via that\\'s the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 😒 Did somebody say flight upgrade? how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. This day and age message through Twitter travels fast. trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye! this is very disappointing. This is about customer service. boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can\\'t wait to give up my gold status for AA. my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous. nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance? that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help obviously no one knows a darn thing around here. What are we to do if this does not get resolved? I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time. I\\'m not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I\\'m extra bloated. DM sent. This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous. delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays. uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change? I\\'m rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I\\'ll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $? will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board after the \"broken lightbulb\" I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight. don\\'t understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary. flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other Without baggage for 5 days and can\\'t get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever! yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill Bummer. Might have to go with card instead. TY for response though. or I\\'m sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation! I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver we are on two more flights today, let\\'s hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight? I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we\\'re going to miss FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that\\'s fixed but can\\'t board because flight crew didn\\'t stay in boarding area #fail not anymore. Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff. Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket. yes, but they still don\\'t know where it is. I\\'ve been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it. wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I\\'ll burn it for warmth. #united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board. crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that \"sandwich.\" Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed). Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket? now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: your customer service is terrible please send help ASAP to on flight 5957 to Chicago seat 9c #Airlines define \"appreciate\". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback. yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip. that\\'s wonderful. unfortunately doesn\\'t help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation Got rebooked on AA. One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled? It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything. new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail .@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours. is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks? I\\'d rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers couldn\\'t have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That\\'s all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I\\'m not missing one. It was added to my bag .... no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really? Wow is the worst haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don\\'t lie on screensand say it\\'s weather no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting. I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn\\'t pay for the extra leg room my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not. #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest. Stuck in. ORD because United can\\'t find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now. WTH be honest with your customers. This better be the last change or we are driving home. Has our plane left or not! 2nd time in a row I\\'ve been over charged by 100\\'s of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn\\'t have to check my CC everytime Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today? If not tell us now and I will rent a car. I do not want to end up stranded. .@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it\\'s not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG. so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline I\\'m sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don\\'t cut it or you\\'ll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through. what\\'s the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it? flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning \"due to operation\" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today! education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus. Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight. Missing a black box? My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated instead of making seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers I need assistance with pulling your agents\\' heads out of their asses gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an \"UNMET ARRIVAL\"!! Another glitch?? I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac \"waiting for papers\"... Cannot miss my connection at IAH ! worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse. no chance in hell. I\\'d rather walk. Worst airline ever. is the worst major US airline. More proof: they\\'re boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather. Wtf? Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49 don\\'t know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love. disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives. unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate. Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal! I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for members is a nightmare can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection? I\\'m counting on you, please don\\'t let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination? #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation oh united, how much I despise thee! your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world. what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!! Why don\\'t you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I\\'m still wating for my tickets!! I\\'m getting really angry and disappointed! then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again. So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer. Thanks great news that u won\\'t refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses how are you going to rectify this? Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they? 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim #inefficient has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument. its in black and white. EU law and all that €600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money accordingly? U dont respond at all \"the extra care airline\". #unitedairlines they don\\'t care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don\\'t have 1 Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :( it\\'s a shame the great customer service wasn\\'t continued in SFO. Slightly absurd #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys. still awaiting a reply from ur customer services? 18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines has happened on other airlines and they\\'ve given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems. thanks, I\\'m booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis. agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to 1st class. Prebooked? Really? Your dissatisfaction is und There were plenty of empty seats in coach \"@united: Your dissatisfaction is understood. Crew members traveling for duty are pre-booked on f\" all good, didn\\'t die or anything. As they say \"you get what you pay for\"! your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service. Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United! I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of Really? 9+hours???? We don\\'t like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We\\'ll have you on your way ASAP After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can\\'t UAL be honest with its customers? well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven\\'t left the airport yet. a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn\\'t have problems would be wonderful agent did help me. My point: there\\'s a problem &amp; I don\\'t want it to mess up somebody else\\'s plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls? .@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I\\'m also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system. I would appreciate an answer on why we weren\\'t alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed. #showsomerespect WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with I think I left my phone on my flight. Help! hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response they were empty upon takeoff. Why can\\'t someone sit there? here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it\\'s 2/19... 7-10 days I\\'ll get a response, BS! - Thanks. Formed submitted. I\\'m not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though... €202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots? rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement. I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ? nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I\\'ll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family it wasn\\'t a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn\\'t an issue either. thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven\\'t really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from Yes my flight was rebooked. I\\'m just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time. any solutions? I\\'m over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup I did they did not. I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don\\'t have that ID- you should find it it is cool. Your customer told me they didn\\'t care either. It is expected is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD - dpted 8:30pm -checked week\\'s average for UA3645 -shameful! 7 day average 7:54pm fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there. I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 😞 .@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now. stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer? recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again. it\\'s freezing on the gate bridge#waitingforbags#united#EWR landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn\\'t the crew here#tiredcustomer I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress? I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport. How will you make this right? enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match. after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.😡 broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline? can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm thanks KP. What\\'s going on w/4840 tonight. Bad update online and phone. Can\\'t u give customers good info. Not waste their time?! 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site! 4840 WTF! Why can\\'t you update your times in a timely manner? You\\'ve known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That\\'s the last flight out tonight. HELP ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619- remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ? WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? next time. I\\'m in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here. you know it\\'s bad when you\\'re praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome playing hide and seek with the gate. \"We can\\'t find it, it should only be a few more minutes.\" so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed. 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can\\'t figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 stop picking on us #CLE booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are €67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land! I\\'d rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!?? Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation. 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O\\'hare... Painful this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it\\'s still in Albany and they won\\'t have a plane. Someone is compensating me Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one? WHAT?! Y\\'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too! .@united just curious why you\\'d board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no? just changed again. This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate? - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays? be worse?oh you can\\'t! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning. flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this. Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account! should contact me and the others on my flight who can\\'t get their website to work. None of our info is valid! over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience. silence is very telling thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn\\'t break my Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM I\\'m confused. After your agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection “@united: See information on our boarding process: ^KP”. I get group 1&amp;2. Just no reason on 3/5. Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet. one hour after departure time and still no update! I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe? how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever! now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more How is this considered \"on time\" if it\\'s arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont… And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with now. yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can\\'t seem to know why the plane hasn\\'t left Albany. #Fail still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail an update on flight 5979 would be great! wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated what is the problem with your flights to ny today flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins) Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines! What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours. Frustrating! not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it\\'s about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working Your survey is too long. I fly a lot of segments and I\\'ll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute. can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ?? would be hard to be worse than last time but I\\'m sure you\\'ll give it a shot service staff to is less than friendly! Can you transfer my bags too? I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight. tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done. you had us REBOARD without the captain. So now we\\'ll be sitting in here for another 20+ min? On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I\\'m Late Flight now? just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP! More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10. Last flight 11:15p. The construction going on is very inconvenient. care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining. A man at 10p at LAX club. More..... smiling? NOT!! worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!! we\\'d prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline why do you bother surveying me! worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done. On time is not in their vocab. I\\'m taking my premier status to A Donna and Juan still the best in the United Club_ too bad UAL does not get it I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go. How about you look You guys are atrocious. Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum. I\\'ll be switching back to delta. I have and been denied! I called and got hung up on. Did speaks with manager on second call Club DEN, East or West, both are disgusting. installed and working are not the same. Kicked me out after an hour and wouldn\\'t let me back in. Four wasted hours. that\\'s what I tried to do, but when entering email into 2nd device made email typo. No way to fix it &amp; no option to log out/in!!! so the 4-6hrs that you told me was what? A guess?? They\\'ve apparently had the bag 20hrs now and no call. still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can\\'t tell me its location . How come can tell u at any given minute where it is? seriously? After waiting 2 hours on the plane for my 10:20 flight to leave at 3pm I have to leave the plane? Great. Just great. \"We like hearing from you.\" So why haven\\'t you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? Rude grouchy agent at Dulles check-in just got my 19 hour trip off to a lousy start. He needs a nap or something. 1k use to be special. 80 people in group one. Why not board global AND 1k together? thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife\\'s 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30. Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks As it always is. Helps to communicate to customers. I\\'m not as sure as you are. how does that help me with my customers that I couldn\\'t meet with (and subsequently lost)? problem is on laptop not phone question - was given food vouchers but can\\'t use on plane..how come the wifi in the ewr lounge reminds me of the old days of dial up needs to pay for my car. I could have been on my flight if 4 help desks did not say it already left. Shame. too long for 140 characters Bos-SF was in between waivers. Business Cancelled Flighted due to weather before/after. No flexibility/compassion in extreme circumstances = 😔 tried that already &amp; tried forgetting the wifi network connection. Still forces log in with incorrect email. Other suggestions? I see you tweeting as little as 7 min ago. Are you just ignoring my CS request? #CantLogOutOfUnitedWifi or did you mean 24-26? has it been 4-6hrs yet? anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting! does a great job of answering public messages. Direct private messages, not so much. I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won\\'t waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms. how\\'s my refund coming along?? ANOTHER F*CKING DELAY IN THE PAST 32 HOURS!? 777 from SFO to HNL with ZERO entertainment systems???!!!#youareonyourown how do you log out of wifi in flight? Don\\'t see any option and made typo when logging in. HELP!! flight UA5631 from SFO to Burbank has been delayed twice now. Still no plane in sight. Get it together. Just saying the truth. You don\\'t even an email! #2015 MR, she\\'s on her way now, but thought id detail the extravaganza for you... #dobetter #please we followed the baggage rules on your website and was still charges $150. But only going one way I sent you a dm hours ago Need to track lost luggage being shipped to me. Need ph # for human. Not automated 800-335-2247. no it weighed 45.5 and it was the only checked bag nonrefundable, hence I wrote $200! Doesn\\'t make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up! you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment. I\\'m not sure I understand your tweet. I\\'m a minor and freaking out bc I might not make my connecting flight to Hawaii so yes I\\'m frustrated I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime even so, change could not be made online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers! Case ID 8544484 your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don\\'t recline. to DM you I have to follow you and I\\'m not doing that. Plus they\\'re no more options. That\\'s why I had to fly with you. #epicfail - why am I sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am huh? I have sent 16 crash reports in Feb alone. 8 in one day. Only app I have that consistently crashes. I was abused , threatened and forced to travel in a lower cabine (last seat) in yesterday\\'s flight from Houston to Sao Paulo Contacted yesterday and was told that there\\'s nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service??? unfortunately, that doesn\\'t help. Just an automated computer. airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time it is. They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they’re interested. Responded to your DM and no response back... I must stop my relationship with you. You\\'ve become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over your customer service is lacking and you owe me a camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline. whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers - this is absurd... messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It\\'s STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!! I guess that\\'s not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers. Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay. need to chat with an actual human ASAP! I got an email saying \"changes to my MileagePlus account are confirmed\" but I didn\\'t make any changes. Help? 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good what a joke. Hang up on customers!! Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren\\'t charged Just hung up on me!! So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail really hoping to get some help here. On my 5th attempt to get a resolution, and lost count of transfers. help please! #mileageplus I sent you a dm with my file reference number.. I just want to know if someone has located my bag even if it\\'s not here yet. can you help from there? UA4935 can\\'t take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour. That doesn’t make any sense. I’ve been 1K for over 5 years, and you’re making it harder to keep me loyal. I need you to get my cousin to PDX, she\\'s on 2 days of travel now and we\\'ve had to hire other sitters til she arrives, thx for that the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/ I did, and as I thought, nothing happened I\\'m not booked on a 1:30 return flight.. the flt TO ORD is correct. Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives? I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen. I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don\\'t understand why there wasn\\'t a better estimate 3 hrs ago \"where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline\" #wellplayed #jokesonus why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place? I\\'ll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option I’ve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received? that\\'s what I have been told. But refund doesn\\'t really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it? please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight? - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight.... reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn\\'t wanna take a chance, Booked myself on instead - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!! fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying sure... You\\'ve been saying that for as long as I\\'ve been tweeting about your obsolete fleet. Promises are free. Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense? i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15. Never to fly United again as they don\\'t check their planes properly. Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH .@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now. UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA. spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees. Random stranger comes up and pays the fee. #Randomactsofcorporategreed hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life. booked a flight yesterday, appeared in my account + confirm email but since a few hours all disappeared and err \"no segment in this\" no- we are boarding- but why can\\'t your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!! EWR ppl told me to call 1800#, have 2x/day since Monday. Still at layover loc. have that ref # tho. Any help appreciated. Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful. we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez. you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn\\'t have a pilot? Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in? no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it thx. Come hell or high water... worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn\\'t do the same. #stillwaiting. - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still layover airport.Have that ref # tho. to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now? ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me. ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again... ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr... spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today... loses my luggage and loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to in the am! oh flight was fine. my lost luggage? not so much. looks like I\\'ll be at least a half day Late Flight to my conference in Santa Monica... 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife ^GJ flight 1101 didn\\'t have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here. : Unhappy with United\\'s service? Read Ralph Nader\\'s open letter to UAL\\'s CEO. Leave a comment or RT. the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice this happens all the time. United pilots are always in the exit row. America treats there customers better than their employees. yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats. Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2) error message said couldn\\'t process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2) 4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight 50 min and still counting... ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate ..shows total miss management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was rude in stopping a carry-on bag... your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don\\'t work you cheap as);: if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn’t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free. Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that\\'s he\\'s going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He\\'s a hoot! ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I\\'ve EVER experienced. Makes look amazing. #UnitedAirlines I can\\'t tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg. ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround the B gates are very far though UA5029 from RIC, UA507 from ORD, &amp; UA423 from DEN -ALL DELAYED for non-weather issues. Way to go, youre batting 1.000! But no hotels I would have made it if you hadn\\'t already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation. how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out. Trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help? I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take? because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!! My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air! get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give? I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi it\\'s not there we tried. It\\'s already here in cancun just no one has delivered it what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your \"customer feedback\" its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service? oh no, I\\'m rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation. my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!! lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We\\'ll wait. I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way... well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You\\'ve Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me. &amp; I\\'ve been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives???? was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!! this is despicable I spoke to many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight. Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL! you can\\'t claim \"weather\" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won\\'t you\\'re missin the point! There was no \"weather\". You\\'re lying! Seats was broken. But u claim \"weather\" to get out of hotels. Classy are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year? this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain I bet doesn\\'t turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me yes I have #CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering. can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks. I\\'m asking if you can simplify the communications- thx OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It\\'s getting real old real quick!! how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been.. Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight. can you get a gate for UA4727? Turrible. is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security? i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn\\'t look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that\\'s not guaranteed plz don\\'t advertise wifi if it\\'s not gonna work thanks #worstflightever Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times. A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn\\'t add up. hello. I\\'m overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can\\'t call customer service but can you help me? I knew I should\\'ve flew lol UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with? My feedback and concerns via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences. just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked! It was quite enjoyable. 😊 Except now he\\'s stuck on the runway in Houston. 😕 makes total sense, except flight wasn\\'t full :) I\\'ve got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded. now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O\\'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight. well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on costs $165 #customerservicefail I\\'m still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection. Not sure what happened MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery 2:30 am I\\'m flying on the way back. I rarely fly them but let\\'s see if they are any better.... it\\'s almost like we\\'re punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int\\'l flights, it\\'s crazy no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag... flying tomorrow from mexico to US. Mileage tkts dont show 1k status. Help correct date is 2/11/15! 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you? a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required can\\'t DM, you\\'re not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats. the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us 1 hour since boarding began and we\\'re still sitting at the gate. #UA507 Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to \"fix\" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can\\'t be determined better. you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline idea: if u don\\'t want us to be frustrated don\\'t Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn\\'t arrive until 6:07 please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine thanks I\\'ll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to. I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to.... I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay? “@united: We don\\'t want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one. 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please! nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad... #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better? - my son left his tablet on plane. Am out of country and can not call easily. Is there an email to contact? I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed. thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr! just informed you don\\'t reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you Midland couldn\\'t get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there. this may be the last time I fly your airline. Is your company motto: \"I do not care!!!\" I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.\" #idonotcare you should tell that to the staff at LAX then.

How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!! again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won’t fix it. 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won\\'t move.

I showed you this problem, and you said to go…? then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again. free hotel doesn\\'t make up for such poor customer service and disregard it\\'s messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting. mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail how else would I know it was denied? You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who\\'s left holding the bag. #flyunited Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.

Still won\\'t fly ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else. note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf I\\'m on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that\\'s in UnitedFirst. you already have vomit so you are halfway there is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !! fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people. you guys suck. You delay flights but can\\'t hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United it was an international flight, and we didn\\'t get our new eta until we were in the air. - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello ! Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out. $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse? Unbelievable hypocrisy!! On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this. now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse... thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain The third wheelchair is broken! my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service. Do they care, nope. Delayed until 7:55. very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it I feel completely cheated I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there. 0162431184663. 3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket. if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff IT-problems with the link? #3thparty I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me can I get some help changing a ticket. 40 minutes on hold and counting.... was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup Your MileagePlus signup page is broken. $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I\\'m gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours... FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful. so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun once again your customer service rep was rude! I asked a question and in turn got attitude. Jane was no help. Disgusted again! can you not see the thread? poor old United: never seem to get the response right :) obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport also why can\\'t I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I\\'m a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on Hypocrisy I\\'m sorry, we\\'re not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP I shouldn\\'t have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL eventually. You should approach bags like they get it. What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago? said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund. how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt. we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected. if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase. Same if you choose to vary it by airport! We want a FULL refund!! wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united. I\\'m 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn\\'t bad!👎👎 don\\'t check your baggage if you don\\'t have to. They will lose it! I\\'m hoping we don\\'t miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN! well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated. We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?! You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection? Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! Call customer service and of course they just say \"theres nothing we can do\" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line. Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for? Classic flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input? A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering. thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can\\'t believe you guys actually charge people to \"fly\" united If you have had any issues with United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead. just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn\\'t like the exchange rate? #doublestandards so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn\\'t receive, how do I know this won\\'t happen this time? stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone. calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke. They couldn\\'t get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself. I\\'ll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter. United airlines should be ashamed. Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-( missed it. Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight... yes still need assistance I don\\'t have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections ! thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive. But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty. My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times. If I am no show, you\\'ll know why! Ridiculous. you\\'re just using automated responses and don\\'t have the decency to actually care/respond JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It\\'s ok! I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone no claim number. Haven\\'t been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone? worst service ever 😈 thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option? can\\'t believe United can\\'t find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice I am furious. You\\'re firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain. Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..😡... sorry, I hate united. i won\\'t get to see my family until Thursday Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you? thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.

Please. plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I\\'ve flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible you\\'d learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want customer service 👎 Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O\\'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled. .@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now? Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won\\'t leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened Supposedly, they\\'re out for delivery. I\\'ll believe it when I see it. Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :) Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I\\'d like assistance in getting compensated for my bag. probably wouldn\\'t be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993 I can\\'t even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years. no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded. Nothing got refunded as of yet So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I\\'m stranded away from home and work? you are really trying me today. no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition. quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can\\'t tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!! flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don\\'t you figure out a solution and announce once? bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee. who can tell me where they are? flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful. each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don\\'t even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats! flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she\\'d been txting on waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude I don\\'t see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure. I don\\'t need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic! thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn\\'t miss my transfer... - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department? We have submitted our claim through email without success. I\\'m not this person, but I\\'ve been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home. flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up! I just need to get to RIC tonight. I\\'ve been in EWR for 24hrs now. which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline. It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren\\'t honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here? with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus. 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no. yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!! the refund request functionality on is broken.i get a time out error. Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate. giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay. $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service! Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it. 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can\\'t? Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I\\'m on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed! when is my plane coming? Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane. Not fast enough. No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful. my mother\\'s flight was delayed from phl-ord. We\\'re on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum. Blegh is Late Flight again. Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew. Really! Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home spending the afternoon Mia. Not your fault. No lounge? Very inconvenient. costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response I somehow think I\\'m going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime. I guess we\\'ll see. of course I need help. I\\'ve been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX. I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy? you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven\\'t heard anything about it since, when do I get it back? feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!! Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don\\'t notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant. + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation. .@united we rebooked. But and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating. + that\\'s the gist of what the flight attendant told her. BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? + +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger\\'s shoulders. + No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business. sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate.. Sigh Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can\\'t accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY! first-class #cockup did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive! Bad coffee, but the juice is ok. #GetPhilz United Terminal SFO Airport why am i mot getting my refund? .@united nothing apparently. I\\'ve flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks. didn\\'t get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard... You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD) THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last... what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won\\'t work #hopeless .@united call my work and tell them it\\'s your fault I\\'m Late Flight is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on i have items of sentimental value that I\\'m heartbroken are missing still waiting for a reply please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn\\'t there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!! Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can\\'t yet tell what any problems are except see snow. I like delays less than you because I\\'m the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher and don\\'t hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am. still waiting. Just hit one hour. although I\\'m not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can\\'t get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!! Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!! still no update text #2053 &amp; still no response to email fr1/5/2015 SR #256746438028. Feel like yr losing customer service/care your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix. my wife had been in group A in prev. flight but got bumped for some reason. Alone with two kids. At least put her in group A my flight was delayed 4 hrs. I\\'m 5 months pregnant &amp; supposed to be caring for my mom whose in surgery now. Very upset. Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do? poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can\\'t even leverage it #bullshit Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could\\'ve drove home in the time I\\'ve been waiting can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven\\'t gotten through has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids. never again. oh look you just delayed our flight an additional half hour now arriving at 6 officially five hours after planned. 😡😡😡😡😤😤😤 belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree they were moved to the 210pm flight #4649. Main concern now is luggage arriving with them. They were told that SW was having got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience. thx but I\\'ll be expecting a credit for this leg. appreciate y\\'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac 20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous...... have u seen any of the messages the past hour ? went to purchase a flight that I began processing not even 4 minutes earlier and the points had gone up - any help? I\\'m so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn\\'t help! its flight #218 of that matters to you all. Hell next we all won\\'t get our luggage properly transferred #facepalm #smh your phone service sucks are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I\\'m on... and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane trying to change my reservation, been on hold for 45 minutes, and can\\'t do it online-was directed to call. Help? My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online? Yo, I\\'m trying to make a change to a reservation but whenever I select the flight it says, \"Unable to price\". Please help! great now we are all de boarding perfectly plane is shot. Fml. Plans are screwed. Thanks for nothing had to let us off the plane bc the toilets done even work! There goes my family vacay to playa del Carmen, Mexico! #neveragain thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest. I was told by customer service that only customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds. over two hours now. Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok. horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again. need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity. #FAIL Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what\\'s up with that? then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal was on flight 2373 from CHI-BUF last night, almost 2 hour delay cuz someone got on the plane without a pass - sounds safe. 1/2 nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points? Rapid Rewards program sold me short. #Lasttweetaboutthis but still #disappointed. freezing in the plane where your airline people screwed up our boarding passes on the way back from puerto Vallarta. This is horrible and we are from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable do you know that your lost baggage portal doesn\\'t work on mobile? It\\'s a 404 if you\\'re going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn\\'t take the length of the flight to open a page your website has now reverted my 1st flight to only a 5-minute delay. But it\\'s changed, so is that reliable information? SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays. unfortunately once the call was answered service was horrid. SWA was the role-model of finger pointing &amp; excuses #DISAPPOINTED frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is.... on hold with customer service; you may be quicker. I rebooked trip for a lower fare. Where did the difference in $ go? and thx for not responding I booked a flight on my phone and then never got a confirmation email. How would I go about getting that? Supposed to take off almost 2 hours ago....#vacationfail #frozenwater? #gettingimpatient #theycouldatleastofferfreebooze how come I\\'m not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site? mins and no answer. My wife and baby need to get on that flight. She arrived 2 hrs prior. Please help. Venetia Crook my wife and 9 month old might miss flight and next direct is 210 pm. Mother in law been on hold with customer support for 30 flight 1614 FLL to ATL. My wife traveling with infant. Line to check baggage 200 people long due to your computer system crash Hey, friends. When I phone the A-list number your IVR hangs up on me. Multiple times. Not sure how to proceed? LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can\\'t be the only one with this issue on flight 1625 INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing. Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can\\'t be done online? Adding RR number to a stay is too hard. Won\\'t take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful. NOR fly to Toronto?!?!? You\\'re killing me smalls....... I have used you guys for most my travels, but this last experience I will never use southwest again! #worstcustomerservice #VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed Is there a way to receive a refund on a trip that was Cancelled Flight online instead of calling? Your phone lines are super busy. Switching planes due to mechanical problems. How does reboarding work? Was A49, now at end of long line. Stuck in middle? Why, when I booked via phone after calling the A List preferred #, didn\\'t my KTA get added to the ticket??? Must I use web? Tried for VIP Live in The Vineyard but yr site went down, by the time I got in 2 redeem pts those packages gone. why was Southwest only airline to Cancelled Flight all flights from Charleston? Was 7:50pm flight Cancelled Flightation really weather reLate Flightd? Thanks for the text, but not exactly timely 8). Data throughout issues today maybe? I called the 800 # and the rep there was pleasant but less than helpful! Told me I was SOL. Train them for consistent #CX! 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?! I hate evolved seating. knees in the seat pocket I \"heart\" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations. Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate. can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay my bday was yesterday and my girl gave birth to my first born and I couldn\\'t get a courtesy flight change from Lynn... THANKS! no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight. weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can\\'t because meeting was today. when and why was flight 4471 from MSP Cancelled Flighted this AM? I luv y\\'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna. i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call Getting tired of typing little notes give us some more clever advertising about #bagsflyfree is that because #badpolicy allows you to #cheatcustomers it\\'s just the principle - it\\'s hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn\\'t give me anything #wrongiswrong customer service you shouldn\\'t use those words wasted my time and took my money #BadBussiness #Theft three hour flight to Orlando and no wifi? Uncool. #firstworldproblems I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me customer service at FLL, BWI,and PIT have been terrible.no one knows where his bags are.his is on a job with no clothes &amp; gear After multiple attempts, I was finally able to submit them Late Flight last night. up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might \"know\" but don\\'t show it. darn! I bought it on the wrong device! No way to switch I\\'m sure? hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do. #filmjobnoequipment #nowarmclothes you need to redeem yourself. I lost respect for you tonight #lostbags #filmjobnoequipment way to fuck up and lose bags. My husband has no warm clothes and no equipment. #youdidit #notcool wifi stays connected about the lifetime of a higgs boson When will your phone agents be able to give the correct departure times for CUN? When can we checkin online for international? making me miss #TheBachelor right now #wah we can let #bags flutter because we charge travelers that had to change dates #fullprice and we don\\'t let them travel won\\'t let me send a DM because they don\\'t follow me.. #lovedflyingwiththem #notanymore #wrong #badpolicy your welcome. It was the thoughts of nearly the entire plane. has become like every other airline #crooked I can\\'t believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked here is my conf #F8NEQM. My flight was delayed for 3 hours while my friend waited for me on her bday. Please follow up. Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don\\'t say anything at all! disappointed in the \\'service\\' I\\'ve received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT very disappointed in your customer service right now. definitely not feeling the luv. what\\'s worse, 2nd time this winter. Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service Should be a way to give voice to customers who pay for services that are not satisfactorily delivered. #justsayin I am genuinely surprised you all don\\'t upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service. : This is the second time in a row I haven\\'t received text updates about flight time change. Don\\'t offer if you won\\'t use it you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200 for business class? Stay classy hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed Taylor. U gotta love SWA responsiveness at the@very least huh? NOW you love me? After taking my money and only taking me halfway home. Sorry. Too Late Flight oh, ok! all good! looking forward to escaping the cold for a bit! thanks! wifi is so slow! What is the point having one if can\\'t get on the Internet?! Ugh... hasn\\'t evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights. stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!! been all up and down the area where the pic was taken and don\\'t see any albums. my question is this: what\\'s up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats? prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don\\'t even know why it\\'s behind schedule. u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for 36 hours :/ prove it thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really? The problem is apologies don\\'t help. Results matter and it\\'s proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that. is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN do these scavenger hunt locations have anything in common because I\\'m playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL. ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury. sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action. like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio? how about #destinationdragon tix for tonite for the inconvenience since I am not there to play scavenger hunt? right? We\\'re delayed so I\\'m crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows? 10+ people pre boarded Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer! Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can\\'t load an email. why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149 but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!? is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm????? will continue to be my airline of choice. -most frustrating travel day I\\'ve experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?! Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle. But for real, you should fire I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty I can. Doesn\\'t it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them? Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice. weren\\'t too \"sincere\" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home.. pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck? hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow. this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. Sorry to bother you, but I\\'ve been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back? your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha yeah they\\'re somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting. Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response. Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy When will the flight resume? I don\\'s see it in the open schedule. :/ That does sound hopeful. It\\'s a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time. My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me. I regret not flying you this morning doesn\\'t support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness how many others didn\\'t know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ? a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it\\'s being abused every airport... it\\'s not disappointment, it\\'s a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it\\'s becoming a problem that\\'s pushing Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight? it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :) My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn\\'t room and I\\'m screwed. i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag. Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight. I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged. Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat? res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change counter #fail my friends from Boston stuck in Denver. Her name Jane. Please contact her. I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours. Wasn\\'t able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage. I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn\\'t stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!! Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help! I did. Still haven\\'t heard a thing. I hope this isn\\'t a real life scene out of the movie \\'Flight\\' ..... her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040 Password reset email is incredibly slow to arrive today. Checked spam folder, too. Web site says a few minutes, but 15? :| I\\'ve had TERRIBLE service in three airports in 10 hours. Glad they don\\'t care we kind of need to be home. #SellMyPointsSoon on hold for 15+ min...no estimated answer time. Any help here? I\\'m going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying What\\'s up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I\\'ve been on for over 15 min. flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours. Another week another delayed flight bag in possession but no clothes in bag?? you\\'re really going to let and get the best of you? Please get back with my about my airtran credit Q4VNMB, I call and I\\'m being told that I will, but I never get email/call back pleaseeee resume direct flights from FLL to PHL. I don\\'t want to fly with anyone else 😩😫😢 what to do when you show up to your destination with no clothes in your suitcase? #nakedmeetings #awkward does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights? customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $\\'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn\\'t sell out. loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable. how about fixing the wifi! 3rd flight where it\\'s not working. 800 series plane so not like it\\'s an old plane. #1687 MDW-SAN. Like most flights, if I\\'m watching free TV it works but won\\'t hardly access any websites - including your own. almost at the gate for 1156 to SF. Please wait 60 more seconds. Paid for early bird boarding and got B46. I said to lady, \"well, that system is about dead.\" She didn\\'t understand All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow. Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don\\'t even know where it is, Please help. - really? All other carriers are staffed and you\\'ve got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC thank you for Cancelled Flighting my flight, last minute of course, to #GIS2015. I\\'m now missing one full day of my trip thanks to this! you got me home over an hour and a half Late Flight but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst in existence. #fail needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage. Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents\\' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.) flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx you\\'re right, I do. I\\'ve been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night. customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it\\'s not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now. is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 💔😪 nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass. luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business. now I don\\'t get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me. what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn\\'t remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over. It was never really \"lost\" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren\\'t sure what flight but I have it - TY! is not being responding to the athletes. #notcool #Southwest A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can\\'t even call them? 617-653-3040 would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time. .@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it’ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 😕 me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal? thank you : 8UXZJ2 Paid for early bird and sat in back 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night. it\\'s ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can\\'t seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help? A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail. I understand. But it\\'s consistent, and been consistent for years. It\\'s known around the country. been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me. i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn\\'t help me bc i can\\'t get it until I\\'m flying back home. For example, can\\'t pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight? Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust. Don\\'t apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM. after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 😣 why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information but to make us tru to find space in other flights. This customer service is as bad as no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I\\'m last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$! first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan. very disappointed in your handling of tonight\\'s Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight. Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies. please start flying to Huntsville so I never have to fly American Airlines again no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar. But expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-. Our flt was canx at the last minute for \"weather.\" We flew home on weatherless really shouldn\\'t offer sweeps if your link isn\\'t going to work! B Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can\\'t be done online? WIFI is so slow it totally precludes working on the web. Will NOT book SWA for business travel. Wish I hadn\\'t lit $24 on fire everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again! staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can\\'t load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable. You\\'ve inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit everyones flights who were Cancelled Flightled today DESERVE 1 How about auto check in for CP holders? Come on. wifi is the worst $8 investment I have ever made. sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason. All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting couldn\\'t be bothered to help with my lost my luggage. Not a single helpful employee owner to be found in BWI. Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag. I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven\\'t received it. I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time. I\\'m gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!! I\\'m a huge fan and give y\\'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi! we understand air delays which are out of your control, terrible telephone support, apps and online access that do not work?? now I can\\'t board thanks. You guys moved me to standby. I\\'ve been holding this boarding pass since 7pm yesterday Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained been sleeping on the floor like I\\'m homeless and now delayed flights because the equipment isn\\'t working! I have a job to get2 you guys should stop doing service in Denver it\\'s horrible I get stuck here every time! I\\'ve been here almost 24hrs Had a very unpleasant experience over the phone with one of your agents re: a Cancelled Flightled flight. I have the name &amp; agent ID. your wifi is angering me with its slowness we\\'ve been at the gate a long time. We\\'re gonna miss our connection at MDW. Ack! Sort of, but I\\'m arriving a day Late Flight and have to incur overnight costs in a connecting city. Not cool at all... promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white? just sent it if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue baggage delivery at BWI very delayed and unnecessarily chaotic. Disappointing after a long trip! From a frequent traveler most other carriers were flying out way past SW Cancelled Flightlation. and got their passengers out much Late Flightr!!!!! extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it\\'s Monday afternoon! I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service! your \"complimentary\" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn\\'t wish this on my worst enemy! worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled Flightled our flight and rebooked us four days Late Flightr! my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What\\'s the process for damage reimbursement? ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed - thanks for Cancelled Flighting our flight to BOS. We\\'re stranded in DEN til Wed night. The 7 of us will never fly #southwest again I was trying to find airfare for my family. Your prices are ridiculous! Almost $1000 more than #notmadeofmoney our flight is delayed till tomorrow curse the weather now I\\'m so lucky for my forced good deed I get to be smashed between 2 huge ppl in the exit row. Thank God I\\'m tiny. 😂💁 BTW I was completely unable to buy wifi for my flight using Galaxy S4. Couldn\\'t zoom out or scroll to touch \"Buy\" it was not - still don\\'t know where skis are and cannot get a call back from bag svc at airport (left several msgs) wife\\'s flight to DAL just got Cancelled Flightled. What does she do to find options to get back home? 1708 PHX-&gt;DAL thanks for the response - flight time has passed - rebooked now &lt;3 &lt;3 Sorry to hear about the WiFi connection, Dani.

No updates from any ground crew Promotion e-mail today (Vegas and Jamaica) has a defective link for the Vegas sweepstakes...it times out with error. No like I said I could not reach anyone at your company so I had to rent a car and chalk the whole thing up to a loss As a frequent traveler, I\\'ve never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove - neveryamind I paid $450 for a flight. 250 for a new bag is easy for business class customers, right? - our baggage motto: we don\\'t cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY Totally ruined my birthday weekend by Cancelled Flighting my flights for no reason and offer no points, drink, transport. #nolove #cali What\\'s happened to your customer service? 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in 2 days &amp; an uninformed and unapologetic staff. #nolove #cali Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you\\'d have less issues #justsaying we didn\\'t nothing was ruined just wet. Just frustrating when after traveling for 12 hours you can\\'t change into clean clothes I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point? I have never had such awful customer service and conflicting service. Outrageous. no I wasn\\'t. After over an hour was too frustrated and had to hang up. Thanks for the terrible service! Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can\\'t find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE. fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile. The link auto changes on mobile. Desktop works fine. 75yo mom says, \"Hire more staff to accommodate your audience\" You could learn lots from her.

You say you care but I now see not so much! Right now, you suck!! I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation. Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them. excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed? The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad. the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn\\'t working properly my Nexus 5. sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn\\'t believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it? What\\'s up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :( it\\'s too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!! Repeating this is policy is basically repeating \"Fuck you\" to your customers. I\\'ll be shopping for a new airline ASAP yeah... that\\'s not what happened. I\\'m really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you.

Waited for CS rep, then put \"on hold\" but actually was hung up on. why doesn\\'t your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline reviewing your oversize policy. Hardcase golfbags are free if under weight. How do we add guitars and instruments to the list? You could have just said \"We don\\'t know\" Why can\\'t I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends! can\\'t DM you without you following me... PWM direct to Orlando on Saturdays, why is this only happening in March?

I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer. suggestion- shades on the windows so travelers won\\'t have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another \"go-to\" airliner What\\'s with the pricing cache?! About to book a flight, refreshed the page, &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. Ridiculous. 😑 A-List Pref credit card holder called exclusive # and hung up after on hold for 14 min. What gives??? Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn\\'t part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn\\'t know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat. 3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter is awful. They have lost my bag and aren\\'t providing any info. This is day 3 and nothing. #WORSTAIRLINEEVER if this flight is Cancelled Flighted or delayed any further I expect full compensation for my park ticket, hotel &amp; flight.. there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again.. and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It\\'s scheduled for 455 not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You\\'ve ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation. you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I\\'ve been delayed 3 times .. keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation. Report was filed but would like to support some active searching. Feels pretty passive now. Info on computer is precious. surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm. Broken down equipment. Why doesn\\'t mean TSA PreCheck show up on my mobile boarding pass? My KTN is linked to my account. no flights to HRL :( is this a limited route? this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I\\'d be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds... #Flight7 Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular. I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn\\'t there be some sort of compensation? A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I\\'ve had. What\\'s up? got \"duped\" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won\\'t give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful real sincere apology! Makes my day! Glad to know flying mail is more important than me. Never flying SW again! #badservice I already follow you and can\\'t DM because u need to follow me back rude customer svc, won\\'t accommodate an earlier flight w/o $400 charge. US Mail takes priority over customers. #badservice RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers.

Download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; I ended up watching the free TV instead. I wish I would\\'ve known so I could\\'ve slept 2 hours more and let my friend know not to wait for me after she lands... nothing express about your express bag drop at Phoenix Sky Harbor used to exclusively fly SW, but Late Flightly, direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched. 😔 why...so... few...direct...flights?

Uncharacteristic of u Yes - with extra $77.

Answer is \"No\". :( could care more about their customer, if there is a reasonable request :( I am going to stop flying with you. Delays everytime. This time due to paperwork? Thnx. Hopefully it\\'s just on the nxt flight up. I\\'ve got 3 shows this wknd.

Do you know where cause we don\\'t &amp; it was delivered somewhere how do i know that my information is not found on other people\\'s account? I can see someone else\\'s reservation, rr # and trip I don\\'t have a conference number. I spoke with Courtney in Texas and David before that. they finally fixed mine after an hour Customer service said it was a known problem that they were using same confirmation numbers for domestic and international looks like my 1 yr anni trip has been replaced w someone\\'s itinerary. Worried abt who can c my flight why would I want to when the last time I did, you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR. #JamesAsworth has the worst corporate account manager #22 Brent. I will now take my 70plus flights to thank you a complete horror show. Flights bumped three times today, before noon, not how to run an airline. #cantblametheweather. 5 hour delay = shortly?“@SouthwestAir: Brendan, we are so sorry to keep you waiting. We\\'ll have you in the air shortly!^RS” step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don\\'t suck so much I\\'m sorry for straying and going with I\\'ve learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness! it\\'s the poor customer service that I have a problem with!!!!! it was this one but looks like the problem is now fixed. .@SouthwestAir 3 days &amp; still not home. Not even off the ground. 3. Days. #PastMyPatienceExpirationDate understand you can only do so much but often it seems like a quick request to the desk is all it takes no questions asked. tried to enter that rapid rewards contest link on facebook but all my browsers kept popping up security warnings 4 it. Just OH-ing a text message I received from an entitled jackass of a friend. how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn\\'t want to wait their turn can get a slip? it\\'s ok...I forgive you guys. now it\\'s delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse Southwest is scheduled to fly to Costa Rica on March 7 but I can\\'t book it online. When will this be available? Service rep didn\\'t say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it. it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on I just wanted Southwest to know that I don\\'t think they\\'re as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into. Customer relations line had busy signal too, called the normal line and the service rep thought I was dumb for not knowing. Didn\\'t see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before. after a long wait of over an hour my mother\\'s bag did not make it. We filed a report and are waiting. Thanks for your help when will sw return to customer service? Business travelers made sw now sw ignores us. your app repeatedly crashed and failed to display my name when checking in. Was unable to use app. No I have not. yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday can &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot home is not accurate anymore. boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn\\'t our plane. Now an hour delay. 😭😭 TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn’t enough. #freedrinkcoupons she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs! I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee LaGuardia who ruined mltple people\\'s travel plans yesterday Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it\\'s not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated? why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes? really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate??? Jax2BNA. Like we haven’t waited days to get home #notokay There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don\\'t want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight. Lastly, for a company that\\'s trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns. Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero. By the way the flight number was 1703, please feel free to fact check my complaints about leave time &amp; baggage time. Therefore, since I\\'ve received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow. I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I\\'m astounded at the lack of concern about customer\\'s flying experiences. This experience was the worse flying experience I\\'ve ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused. So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour\\'s wait. No apologies, no explanation. I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage. Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour! Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight 2 bags fly free! So what\\'s with all the carry-on\\'s? #packingayak First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL. when will you be accepting reservations past August 7? FS4VE7 when I corrected the attendants error she gave me attitude made a rude show of taking back nuts&amp; said \"well i was Late Flight\" I just sent a screen shot of the incident report. I couldn\\'t fly you today &amp; it made the trip harder + had to pay for my checked bag. #DevotedyYours but for today. :( Flight 4110 MCO to ISP delayed.

Rude attendants because now everyone is Late Flight. why is your website downnnnn :( ugh will you please tell me if I\\'ll make my flight out of here tomorrow 8am? I\\'ve been tryin for 3 days now to leave Had a bad experience with them last week. They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla. Why? “@SouthwestAir: I\\'m so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW” I\\'ve been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH 75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It\\'s 1:30 in the morning. where are our bags? We have a tv show to film!! I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft really enjoying sitting at BWI with the door wide open and the a/c on as they fix a \"baggage error\" #sarcasm Engadget Theverge Wired reddit Your male flight attendants must being playing a game called Who can be the Bigger Dick to People. Flight 952 to CHI-MID when you\\'re on hold with southwest for over 2 hours and it automatically hangs up on you. #iusedtoloveu this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back. Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait! No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone. Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab My luggage has still not been found. Luggage is not scanned until final destination. So no way of knowing where it is! Finally got through after 3 hours and all set. Thanks. I did ....it\\'s just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted. please help on hold forever to check in for flight my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE can\\'t believe how many paying customers you left high and dry with no reason for flight Cancelled Flightlations Monday out of BDL! Wow. .@SouthwestAir I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn\\'t solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods. you\\'re 4/4 on blowing it with your customer service.

Can you direct me to an area I can learn more about the improvements? just disconnected my call after 2.5 hours without even speaking to me. #octaviannightmare injured at check in yesterday. U told me to go to dr. on hold with SWA for over hour trying to talk with someone. suggestions? Trying to get through by phone to confirm that funds from a Cancelled Flightled reservation can still be used in the future. Can u help? have you considered adding the \"we\\'ll call you back when we have someone free\" feature to your support line? I\\'ve been on hold with customer service for over an hour. Can you help?! I\\'ve been on hold for an hour now. 59:57 as I type this. Ridiculous! All I need is the link to the chart that has routes, time Flight Cancelled Flightled, reFlight Booking Problems online has not worked, on my second round of hold (3 hrs now). Any other options? kudos to the #RSW CS crew for re-routing PAX to alleviate Over sale due to down graded EQP 800 now 500 do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days? I\\'m an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However, your inflight wifi is no better today than it was 4 years ago. too bad I\\'m getting this memo: \"Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online.\" #FUSTURATED almost 2 hours on hold, 2 hours of my life I can\\'t get back.... Thanks discount for three delays? tried online and told I must call b/c of modifications to my reservation. Been on hold for almost 2 hours. has the WORST customer service of any airline I\\'ve ever flown. I need updates on my flights 464 &amp; 3574. I have been on hold for over 2 hours. Hi-My flight (BNA to LGA) was Cancelled Flighted this morning--#1814. Looks like other flights out of BNA are taking off. Any chance? Cancelled Flightled my flight out of BNA today. Been on hold for an hour. 😠 #frustrated! tried to rebook online but it says that I have to pay $200 for difference in price. Please help I\\'m showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away? can\\'t update my flight online bc it\\'s been Cancelled Flighted twice already. Going on hour 2 on hold. Guys for real. I\\'ve been on hold for 4+ hours including one hangup. Please have someone reach out so I can get my $ back. the last 4 times I\\'ve arrived our gate has been blocked by a slow to depart plane leading to 30-60 min delays been on hold for &gt;30 minutes about my Cancelled Flightled flight. Still not talked to anyone and flight is soon. What gives? Hoping you answer the phone today? husband on hold 2.5 hrs, got disconnected!New wait 30 min. Can\\'t confirm res due to the fact he booked on line! Nuts! why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH on hold for 2 hours and then you hung up 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Running out of daycare for our kids who are trapped at home. this is really unhelpful. Why can\\'t I rebook online? allows other passengers 2 harass u after their gate agents mistakeFURIOUS they are doing NOTHING about it &amp; my 6yo was scared flight was Cancelled Flightled and it won\\'t let me rebook online. Wait time on phone is too long. Please help won\\'t answer their phones #HorribleService #NeverAgain #frustrated #AnswerThePhone We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad. you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing? its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it\\'s coming, then not. They weren\\'t on any flight, they just came Late Flight. Your JetBlue employee just informed us! everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat! Hey guys, why did my last flight earn me 0 pts? 2 aisles of empty #evermoreroom seats and we can\\'t move bc we didn\\'t pay?! #nonsense #Waste #JetBlue #jetbluebos #cheap ’s Marty St. George really has zero clue. How does he still have a job? #nobaggagefees they booked me for tomorrow. It\\'s $250 higher. My 1st reservation is PGFRYZ. Get me on standby list 4 tonight would help. but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I\\'d lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight. ive tried on my phone and laptop :( Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 more👺 just wondering if the website is having issues today. Trying to book a flight with my visa I always use and its rejecting it. upset with the lack of communication we\\'ve received for our \"on time\" flight 1170 out of MCO I\\'ve spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn\\'t help. I probably won\\'t be using JetBlue again. I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200. Are there really no flights from the Bay Area to Chicago anymore? Lame. So lame. can\\'t book a flight because of outdated, forced opt-in \"Verified by Visa\" nonsense. Help a girl out? I just want to get to luggage fees? won\\'t b flying JB again! at least #AA gives platinum pass 2 bags! tired of overchging bg herded like cattle2slaughter it\\'s poop and barely works your wifi is a lie and i hate you Is there an issue with your website and logging on? (App too?) I know I am entering info correctly but cannot sign in! :( having trouble signing in to TrueBlue today, despite right credentials. getting \"We are not able to sign you in\" msg. I appreciate the credit for my troubles but the lack of personal response troubles me. Thank you for credits. However; I submitted complaints about the property on vacation package. Hope you listen! Need your help. I\\'m moving to DC &amp; I want to book a one way fare on your website. It won\\'t seem to let me. Am I missing something? \\'s Once upon a sale that does not include BTV, as usual! #jetbluehatesbtv can\\'t link my flight from last week to my TruBlue account and 1800 num isn\\'t answering..don\\'t make me fly again, dont do it! if you can get us on a flight to Vieques all will be good. Right now, not looking promising. I just DM\\'d you! why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ? It’s a direct flight and the plane is at the gate. we are missing our connecting transportation in Puerto Rico as a result. Need to get to Vieques today. we were supposed to be Vieques by 3pm your customer service today was deplorable. There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice absolutely. The missed connection caused us to miss our ferry to Vieques. Get us to Vieques. Also, flight vouchers. #PRBound why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :\\'( I\\'ve experienced better service making connecting flight from and #badcustomerservice #jfk #pr service getting worse and worse. Plane can\\'t fly waiting on a 2nd aircraft. So much for planning. no seat assignment 5 mins before a flight...line 20 people deep. Guess I\\'m sitting with the baggage? the worst flying experience I\\'ve ever suffered through. I\\'d appreciate my money back. my wife sent me a family invite but I never accepted it. She should not be locked into a family account that never got created. I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can\\'t help. Need help with family pooling asap. customer service says since my wife setup a family account that she now can\\'t join mine for a year??? Help me fix please. full to capacity. I also pid extra for these seats. Perhaps the crew could be more helpful. we have. Twice. They said they can\\'t dim those lights. But they did on our first flight. JFK NYC staff is amazing. The #lax JetBlue... Sending an email with details but it was a disappointing experience you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm. we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we\\'ve been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3 you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3 - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me. but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn\\'t report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner? - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner? - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people\\'s bags? Security cameras? Anything? - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours) absolutely no worries. I\\'m just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!! you just directed me to your mobile website. Where is the direct link? GET IT TOGETHER! if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!! I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe?? not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he\\'ll is your companies problem? mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane what maintenance? The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board that\\'s not a answer! See what you started now Our fleet\\'s on fleek. .@JetBlue Navigating through 2 rebooks due to flu &amp; ice to visit my Mother. Your CS reps have been so very helpful, patient and friendly. well our plane just landed at the international terminal... so they announced the 10 pm new time. there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy not ok to Cancelled Flight flight 1274 tmrw for \"weather\" &amp; to rebook 4 flight the next day when there is flight tmrw night. no compensation? I guess you weren\\'t able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow we\\'re home, you guys recovered, now we can laugh about it and the extra day in barbados. Will you open Cuba soon? Am I the only one who had to look that up? I must be getting old... #damn flight for tomorrow morning Cancelled Flighted &amp; can\\'t seem to rebook me. They can\\'t even get me a seat. No clear answer on why Cancelled Flighted. does transferring trueblue points within family pooling members cost $? This is after having set up contribution-to-pool already. Gotcha... but \"lessening the delay\" ... that part\\'s not happening, right? Social agencies, this is why we can\\'t have nice things. Our fleet\\'s on fleek. “@JetBlue: Our fleet\\'s on fleek. Plz stop I heard companies were studying popular lingo for advertising but this is just depressing and embarrassing. STOP any idea what caused the delay on flight 1316 FLL &gt; Jax ? App still saying I can\\'t DM you... once again my flight is delayed. I hope I dont miss my connecting. Please don\\'t fuck me... I have a girlfriend -_- received a voucher but if you want to improve relations be up front with passengers. three hours on s delayed flight staring a blank screen. At least a heads up so you could download a movie I hate you for this 😒 you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn\\'t working. At least let me get a mag Noooo don\\'t do it, please don\\'t do it 😩RT Our fleet\\'s on fleek. We had some major plane-wide DirectTV issues yesterday. System kept being reset by crew member. Not helping since there\\'s a bunch of us trying to get off at the same time. we haven\\'t even gotten off the plane yet! I can\\'t afford to miss my flight back to Boston! Ugh. Sorry for unfollowing, We just landed in Vegas but not allowed to leave the plane just yet. Thanks for making me miss my flight at 1 pm. #fustrated Just in case you needed confirmation that \"on fleek\" is dead &amp; gone. Our fleet\\'s on fleek. *fights air* No JetBlue… Just… no “@JetBlue: Our fleet\\'s on fleek. Brands: Stop this shit. No, stop. Our fleet\\'s on fleek. This shits gotta stop Our fleet\\'s on fleek.

Stop the madness \"@JetBlue: Our fleet\\'s on fleek. I feel only a few free travel vouchers will assuage my indignation. You respond to complaints about cultural appropriation with more of it!? You\\'re now below Spirit Airlines on my fly list. Not really. I have a flight to catch at 1 pm in Vegas. I\\'m praying I don\\'t miss the flight! Spoke to Corp. Customer Support already. Shame. Probably a reasonable and cheaper resolution to be had. Regards We didn\\'t need this. Our fleet\\'s on fleek. any info on why flight 704 from SJU to JFK is already delayed 2 1/2 hours? “@JetBlue: Our fleet\\'s on fleek. 😐😑 I\\'m sick of y\\'all. “@JetBlue: Our fleet\\'s on fleek. this is what I hate Our fleet\\'s on fleek.

I\\'m reconsidering that decision now after reading this tweet. Why? 😒 Our fleet\\'s on fleek. But, are your flight attendants fucking tho? Our fleet\\'s on fleek. nope. Our fleet\\'s on fleek. no. Please stop. well, now I\\'ll make sure to never fly JetBlue Haha! Our fleet\\'s on fleek. what else on this plane is duct-taped?? #ohboy #shouldigetoutandpush #airplane #flying… Sure did go south after breakfast though! Delayed three hours. :( :( :( someone should screen what you play on your flights. For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look \"normal\" ???? great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. Too bad we\\'re at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags. I believe it\\'s Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn\\'t available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today. All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what\\'s a little delay right. Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:\"your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins\" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer! All correct for rates Boston to Pittsburgh wknd March 14? Rates all of a sudden took off! Made plans, came back to buy &amp; surprised. nope. The \"regular\" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS. Thank you, but that isn\\'t really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site. I would like to communicate directly with a \"Customer Experience\" executive. Does Joanna Geraghty have an email address? Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset keeps getting better. No water on the plane. I don\\'t want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :((( what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight? lol at your \"estimated departure time.\" Plane hasn\\'t even started boarding yet. You can\\'t even get your delays right. you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening. said they haven\\'t started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can\\'t find $100 outfit. 😒 yeah I\\'m aware of that. Hence my original msg to you. 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster. no I asked. Either way it doesn\\'t make the flight less delayed. Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven\\'t contacted me yet. shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta. as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting \"Webpage not available\" after submitting online form are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We\\'re just sittin\\' here on the tarmac waiting. not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better Rats, that\\'s a bummer! is so sloooooow today terrible landing on 915 flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS. Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs! Power of positive thinking, people. appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was \"There is nothing we can do\" idk if that\\'s what you mean Didn\\'t find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail. Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this. #epicfail - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow. No snow on weather map!!! WTF!!! 2 words: \"staff training.\" What a joke- is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don\\'t hold it. 5 minutes. any idea what\\'s going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a \"courtesy report\" apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today? over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man! No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/ - Fix your jet bridges. 40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting! #jetblues didn\\'t work. Fly-fi plus couldn\\'t access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed 👍. I think I\\'ll come take a nap at the terminal. ;) Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not. #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed? the lack of TV made it rough, that\\'s literally why I picked y\\'all over the competitors. But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous. i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi😭 why dont you guys go to maimi??? aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that\\'s just no Can you take off your blacklist... trying to work :( \"Goodwill\" now at $125.00. $27,000 x ? = Fine Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136 thank you! Hopefully it\\'s soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23 hard when you\\'re with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome! even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people? I thought being a mosaic member had \\'perks\\' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I\\'m carrying it on 😒 are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous if only the show was on the flight. No ABC. Oh well. I\\'ll live. #nexttime #andthewinneris... ill call in the morning. too upset right now. im still waiting??? No answer!! the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn\\'t make up for the money lost. being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can\\'t be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk. Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems? I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible! \"Considering?\" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars .@JetBlue ooookay that\\'s silly of you. guess we\\'re \"watching\" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars I\\'ve heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn\\'t allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What\\'s going on? I\\'m dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given I did. They have no idea where it is. thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA?? hey JetBlue. Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9\\'8\" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports. your gif game is strong. well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc? Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK? #annoying your crew didn\\'t say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether I\\'m going to write a post on about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars. I bet his flight was on time. #JUSTWRONG okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn\\'t help bc going on break that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they\\'d come back but did not. 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day. just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I\\'ll be able to go home! what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades? thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned. Tx for the info. Just don\\'t understand why you couldn\\'t accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now. Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks all day how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right. why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem? thanks for the update. \\'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home... WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won\\'t be on this flight unless I pay more. If seats aren\\'t guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats. yes, please get me the seats we paid for. Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM Finally!!! Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM. That\\'s a long flight. AKA BUS I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper. FYI, The last email response - \"we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you\" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future... nice touch. lol last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal. I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight.. I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!! I think it\\'s safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger anything serious I should worry about? Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you?? #jetbluefail Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there\\'s a problem with the plane? Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don\\'t tell me you were snowbound in PBI. sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated. This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there\\'s a problem? #jetblue thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot you\\'re lucky we\\'re still flying you after today\\'s landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids! so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied? if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don\\'t quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail do you REALLY think it\\'s okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your \"terms\" response is insulting. #jetblue What\\'s your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air. if you can\\'t guarantee parents will sit with their children, don\\'t sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue once you go blue you don\\'t go back why are there so many delays to north east cities? kids fly. Don\\'t hire people who don\\'t care about them. This guy. #jetblue I shouldn\\'t be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now. why would you hire a guy who doesn\\'t care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. what\\'s up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting. never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you\\'re still nothing it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you. you\\'ve let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven a 5 year old can\\'t sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable! 5 hours delayed now in hour increments? Really? &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday? no, I haven\\'t done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx! No wifi on this flight so we can\\'t tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA✈️BOS Thank you for the reply. Would\\'ve appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to You also promised to change my wife\\'s name on the account and it is also not done. WTF? You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account. They are still NOT there! 1/2 where is it coming from? I thought Tampa? Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can\\'t seem to get an answer flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in. You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of .... at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination? You just don\\'t get it. It\\'s not about the money, It\\'s about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue. why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn\\'t that a bit stupid? check-in headaches! does not fit in 140 You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 \"goodwill credit\" will make everything hunky-dory. You blew it. every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble?? hey awesome peeps, what\\'s up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs? Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! 😕 What\\'s up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness! 118 to Boston still sitting now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕 backlog is an hour at most, this is over two! Unacceptable!! your agent told us TSA didn\\'t have a crew to get bags! no baggage crew update! Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours.... is blaming for flight 584 luggage debacle! #luggagegate Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-( I look forward to that do much! You failed. That\\'s the answer. Please don\\'t justify otherwise. come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip. When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ. still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row. I shouldn\\'t have to find them, they should tell us. I\\'ve flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn\\'t what it was. if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time? I\\'m over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey. If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don\\'t buy it. our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun. I don\\'t believe so. That\\'s not what the team has told us. also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight. #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections. Please help! Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!! Just wrong. No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time! My wife was with our dog. They wouldn\\'t even let her out off the plane. My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong According to your ground staff, it hasn\\'t even been taken off the plane yet! .@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations At what time? All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it\\'s back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology? Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers? 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit again? flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy... it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed. I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the \"T5 experience\" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month. So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won\\'t start. It that weather reLate Flightd as well. These passengers on plane for 10 hrs. thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children. your hold music sucks. JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too. no excuse though for 3 gate changes though. if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped. get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!? nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can\\'t believe I paid money for this. the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?! this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane! too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You\\'re in league with big alcohol. Shame on you. thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What\\'s the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you. and have empty \"help\" desks there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there Thanks for the THIRD gate change Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We\\'re making a pact to never fly u again what happened to our plane meant to leave 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather. where is the \"award winning service\"? really not acceptable. Just informed plane won\\'t start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk. how much longer to JFK open\\'s I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don\\'t have nothing flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It\\'s 36 and sunny at JFK u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue? unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn\\'t get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email. Thank you just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful it\\'s sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What\\'s the real reason? it\\'s been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous. still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers. what\\'s the delay if the system isn\\'t down? don\\'t think any1 rly knows what\\'s goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12 That is not very gracious of to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours. after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards get flight 16 into the air That\\'s not weather reLate Flightd. You are just being nice and blaming the weather. Airport just wasn\\'t prepared. Investigation time. then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it I\\'m also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT.... It\\'s not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board here\\'s part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn\\'t print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass That\\'s not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway. When it\\'s 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as \"on time\" #updateyourwebsite #489 how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really? Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue seriously? System down? No IT? just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I\\'ll document and send details, off to Boston flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we\\'re getting on isn\\'t this something YOU should do?! Why should I tell your crew how to do their job? your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152? is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc! woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!! hmmm it says im following you. We just got de-iced, but still haning around for the runway to clear.. flt 136 from PHX. Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible all your online resources say we\\'re on time, but clearly we are not. This is not very information age of you... ..... No crew at our gate. why don\\'t YOU tell them to update the boards?! Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can\\'t we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY! you want me to talk to the wall? Its poor Flight management. There is no reason why a scheduled 8:00 pm flight to takr off At 11:00pm . note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I\\'m not onboard why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I\\'m not on the plane yet? ok we got as far as Atlantic City due to JFK being closed. Can you get us to HPN or LGA?? Please? we need an ETA please fly 2301 delayed do to ice at JFK ... Can I switch to a Late Flightr flight for free I\\'m at 4:05 will be nasty in Boston. Have family driving 90 min to pick me up from Erie think flight - what if Cancelled Flighted? best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won\\'t put you standby? #stranded yes, they said the runway isn\\'t ready and they\\'re waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight. I travel for business twice a week and after the fiasco, I\\'ll be flying blue more often. Thanks. won\\'t see my money again after their poor service should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue??? suck and their customer services are the worst whats the point of having a loyalty scheme that they don\\'t honor #badairline how about an update on flight 475 leaving tf green delayed well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100% confirmed that\\'s where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. help flights from to MCO? my flight 475 Cancelled Flighted due to lavatory problems. Can\\'t confirm if they are gonna get a flight from Boston Logan Int some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol? Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What\\'s the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..?? full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school. no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was it\\'s ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year. Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 😒 a voucher.. I can\\'t believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face.. I\\'ve spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more. Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck oh wow and I\\'m complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this I\\'m curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate everytime I come back to Boston it\\'s a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue? that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :( I am But Your customer service is Brutal. flight attendant was hesitant to give me more baby sized cookies Y U NO LET ME OUT AND MAKE FUN SIZE COOKIES #stuckonaplane #sos #babyfood thanks! Yes! order me a rum and coke and get me a hotel voucher because the floor and chairs aren\\'t so cushy here...! You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter\\'s friend, my elderly mother-in-law. They spent several hours waiting. I missed a goal On because of your Inept male stewardess. I should have landed already but I havent taken off yet. you are doing a horrible job at JFK...you need to rethink how you put these routes together. Unprofessional can you let me know status of flight #454 PBI-JFK delayed 2.5hours now on board problem with hatch.. thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn\\'t be so bad but airport is closed! Why did you interupt the Staduim Series on I dont need to see your stupid commercials or Emergency. Info. we are well aware. Insufficient info. No options. just sat on a plane for 3 hours in Dulles #insane #ijustwanttobeinBoston #thanksDC can we get a honest update on departure of flite 454. Been on plane with infant children u suck!we have been sitting here for 9hrs because of ur negligence still waiting for bags from flight 26. It landed an hour ago. Complete waste of an entire day. Pathetic. flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE she did. she\\'s still waiting on a callback....the lack of follow through is what\\'s concerning. smh she has...she hasn\\'t heard from anyone in over a week. a nonstop flight and her baggage was lost/stolen. customer service 👎 we got our luggage after waiting 40 mins and went home right after. Not very family and ADA friendly waiting that long w no chairs. Flight 2202 out of JFK, 2 &amp; 1/2 hr delay. I could get over it if it was just weather reLate Flightd, but considering it\\'s not - Come on figured it out 4 flight 2morrow. Hard to believe with oil so low, and the killing u make that even part of a hotel can\\'t be comp\\'d we saw one, he was as useless as the tsa agents who inspected my shoes disappointed with the missed connection from ROC to SLC and no reimbursement even tho friend who is a pilot said it was due to ATC didn\\'t find them unfortunately :( but he was very helpful and took down my info incase they do get found what crew? No one here is helping. If this is customer service, then please call me. no, we are at a hotel. Also, Jetblue lost my daughters luggage. How do you lose luggage if the plane never actually left!!! lipstick on a pig still a pig. Ur new baggage claim SJU is a disaster. No chairs, 20 mins+ wait for baggage. #fail no more than half an hour wait. It\\'s unreal. Finally first bag coming out. SJU needs to work on this how long does it take for a bag to get to the baggage belt!!!!!#toolong of a wait we\\'ve been delayed and delayed here in Palm beach... Need to head to Westchester. Can you give me some info? Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless. Need better communication! Hey Jetblue, you Cancelled Flightled our flight from ST Maarten to JFK. Stranded my family in the baggage area and lost my daughters luggage your website is seriously horrible and so is your call center!! Almost makes it tempting to fly someone else!! #sodone why haven\\'t you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight? Everyone is saying travel is treacherous. not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start. there is no supervisor available, so they couldn\\'t do anything. I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything. - trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight? we tried. They\\'re not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least. Tell me at what point will u realize u can\\'t fly into DCA tonight- u Cancelled Flightled the 1pm when will u Cancelled Flight the 5:26 making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won\\'t provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA It is physically impossible to make it to the airport, and our flight is scheduled to leave in less than 3 hours. at what point do u Cancelled Flight flights to DCA- other airlines have already Cancelled Flightled I would like to send an email to Lost and Found at JetBlue JFK; I spoke to them this morning but cannot drive their today. we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves. send more service agents so all the stranded passengers can be helped!!!🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘 hopefully this flight Seattle to Boston 2pm will have wifi. Our first one did not and we had to entertain ourselves! #lizaapproved as a customer it feels like i should stick to airlines other than jet blue. I travel for my work for past 5 years never seen $70 I\\'ve been in pricing for 8 years to know that 70 bucks a seat is criminal. 20-30 I understand. #pricing #flying #jetblue #pricewise *cough* #awkward! you guys need live chat. it was but obviously it wasn\\'t linked as there is nothing there when I tried to book with it. quick ? Why is a person traveling w a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn\\'t make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/ got it wish they would communicate more w us continuing you record of never having a flight leave on time. Add up how much time with with my family you have cost me. #jetblue I guess I have to redo the Flight Booking Problems. Ugh! that sucks. Oh well. she\\'s standing here on her cell no announcements no info #thismosaicnothappy someone is here but has no info smh one bag came off and then nothing there\\'s is nothing there because apparently I have to connect them for that to be true. can u see what\\'s holding up flt 1002 bags? One bag came out nothing else for 10 minutes why wouldn\\'t you just credit it right to my account instead of having a separate sign on. That seems pretty ridiculous. it seems I never received an ID, just a password. yes, last month when Boston got the first big snow storm and my flight was Cancelled Flightled. where did my travel bank credit go? I can\\'t call you right now. Love your airline...hate your website. Just tried to book 2 tickets (1 w miles, 1 w/out). Absolute joke. Needs a lot of work! yes, We have de baggage claim, I\\'m so sad for the baggage and how They treat Us 😞 please we need That baggage my mom\\'s baggage is lost, in fly 1557 fort lauderdale-Bogotá today, Colombian employees treated us badly , need help please No changes made. My son\\'s pass printed on same conf #. Just mine not print after I expressed disapptment w/ JetBlue Cancelled Flighted 😢 You have very unhappy customer. After waiting 20 min on hold, rude &amp; uncaring rep has now frozen my acct. can\\'t print bdng pass! the first place but I really didn\\'t need the extra stress at this already terrible time. Oh by the way, I made the flight with 30 that I missed my flight. I had to book this flight extremely last minute due to a family death, there\\'s no excuse for attitude in serious attitude. I was in the fault for running a tad behind but before she even knew my name or my flight info she ASSURED Me I fly w/u as much as I can, however your kiosks were broken in SYR and there was 1 woman working the ticket counter.. She had a flying to Denver March 1st and my flight itenary keeps getting changed what the heck...booked the trip 3 months ago had me on hold foreverrrrrr NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER. We\\'ve waited patiently, not to mention $150 and six months of marathon training, we need 2 be there tmrw. waiting for a flight to FL for 1/2 marathon tmrw 4 charity. U bumped us 2a Late Flightr flight &amp; then Cancelled FlightLED IT. How can you fix this? if you want to fly in a storm that\\'s your right. But give us the choice. We have kids and don\\'t want to chance it. #nixchangefees you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish. “@JetBlue: Thanks for including us on your tour! Did you pack your winter coat?”Unfortunately yes ❄️⛄️ #WereNotinCaliAnymore is the website down? Can\\'t print boarding pass It\\'s not ideal, but it\\'s okay. Better Late Flight than never! :) yeah that\\'s all been done. Define \"incidentals\"? How much can I spend on gear so this trip is not a waste? so you guys lost my bag that had all my ski gear in it. I flew here from NYC to ski. Should I buy new stuff tomorrow? ... on hold for 30 mins placed on hold then hung up on 2nd time in 2 days Only looking for group rates. BOS-SJU 5-12 to 5-19 10 people you\\'re customer service is terrible. #NeverAgain #flywhonotblue now we are delayed until 1:02! This is ridiculous you\\'re flight attendants suck and are always rude :( 4th bad experience with JetBlue tonight :/ says the person who hasn\\'t been delayed for hours and now sitting on a runway with a wailing baby ;) flight 672 delayed from 9:30 to 11:47 now, still sitting on runway over 15 minutes so far. Air travel at its best. 1242 now?! I may cry! why won\\'t the site let me book tickets for nov for jfk to kin? Late Flight again lost almost 3 hours of my bay area weekend not to mention two hours of unnecessary vacation time from work. #flt348 yes I do. I will get you exact data. Your download is fine it\\'s your upload bandwidth and ping that are the issue. Ping especially appreciate the response Worst part is losing the non refundable hotel in Orlando. Your crew blamed wind! Hoping for no more delays! this is awful! flight out of jfk for our honeymoon is delayed AGAIN until 1225 AM, and we lost money on a hotel now! #delayforwhat? flight 348 is a freaking nightmare tonight #sittingonthetarmac #delay I appreciate the speedy response. But the longer you delay the more inconvenience you put on your customers. Please nix change fee! whats going on with flight 2034. Delayed beyond 834. Shouldnt thre flights switch at that point? what\\'s up with the broken tv in seat 6F on flight 1818 today? Planned to catch the game!!! Nooooo I bein calling JetBlue no respond I leave my number no call back I think JetBlue is loosing a customer I\\'m on flt 700 lax to FLL both ppl are sleeping so Id rather not disturb in flight.

Ping terrible / up too thanks for making me miss an important dinner tonight. 2 hr delay and now 20 min on Tarmac... #worst I don\\'t have enough hands to count the number of times something like this has delayed my flight with you guys. Very disappointed. just called that number and left message. Are you at to pass along message to team too? Any option for luggage assistance on the ground at HPN? Flight 2168 delayed 2+ hours &amp; we will have 2 sleeping kids when we land can you ask SLC checkin/bag drop if they found a dark blue/blackish fit bit flex? Would\\'ve lost it there around 445pm MT seriously?? What is going on?! any news on flight 122 pbi-boston delay? Can we wait to arrive at airport based on reported 1 and 1/2 hour delay? .@JetBlue i\\'m sorry. Boarding chaos is underway. Please query again post scrum. were boarding now I\\'m really not impressed. I\\'ve learnt a very valuable lesson . .@JetBlue yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me. .@JetBlue yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality. Dare you. I tried a burger which was good but expensive! Were lead to believe that food in the USA is cheap butnot here! I\\'m a trying ! But I\\'m tired and getting grumpy ! flight1407, it\\'s been a long day! Arrived from London at 11 this morning Why not deal with that while the plane\\'s on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight? looks like their inflatable car seats got left on the plane, so I guess they\\'ll be back sometime!! #savethoseseats Jan 5? That\\'s not summer No, the flight wasn\\'t until 9:51pm, but it\\'s already been delayed. why must you always delay my Late Flight night Orlando flights? 💔 ...second incident of lost baggage. I sent you a DM. Thoughts? maybe announce the delay so we don\\'t sit on the plane on the runway for an hour+ before taking off flight 691 from bos to Tampa takeoff 40 min Late Flight .@JetBlue Ah grasshopper, your twitterz kung fu no good. Hire geeks. Did you discontinue nonstop service from SJC to BOS? Can\\'t find 471 or 472 anywhere Noooo!! Why is our previously direct flight from FLL&gt;SFO diverted to LAS? Now arriving almost 2 hrs Late Flightr. 👎 Well lets see. You could pay for my Negroni with bitcoin. can\\'t seem to DM you guys.. JDHADP Two delays. A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe? - worst view for an athlete; watching your team from the front seat of the chase van #nogearnotraining poor storm customer service, 1hr takeoff delay waiting for the snack cart, rude steward (no names) and I love you guys. #TrueBlue before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time.. No, it is one I\\'m trying to make, but it is probably too Late Flight. I did not see an email that I could call. Pittsburgh International. has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem what\\'s up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm? I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!! what is the reason for the delay CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt? I ❤️ Jetblue but i was on flt 277 from fll to sfo. tke off was over 1 hr Late Flight, div to phx &amp; got in 2 hrs Late Flight. What will be done? sis and 16 month old nephew are. Last nights flight and this am mega delayed. Now this evening\\'s is starting w delays. Why? what is going on with your BDL to DCA flights yesterday and today?! Why is every single one getting delayed? basically stole my glasses, and now I can\\'t drive or see in my classes and they\\'re not answering my phone calls. #thanksJetBlue we\\'ve been delayed for almost 2 hrs. I take JetBlue because I\\'ve had good luck, but today is really frustrating. something they\\'re not telling us (2) we\\'ve been on the runway for over an hour. Now the water pressure is low and taxiing back for maintenance. #1572 thanks for the heads up about the 2 hour delay #sarcasm #patienceiswearingthin #woof when i sign in into TrueBlue, why do I have to do it twice? happens to everyone around me mechanical failure isn\\'t Boston\\' fault. 290 to Boston I’m going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays #itscostingmeincome when your flights delayed :)))&gt;&gt;&gt; sorry to report we are stuck on Tarmac.. Being held so #notwheelsup I was a bit steamed in conjunction w/my new 7-hour wait at first, but having sat down and bought a bit of tea, I\\'ve settled some appreciate what you\\'ve done on your end to make this right, but still unhappy with initial incident. Will be calling. Lines may be extra long or security slow, but seems your employees too quick to blame customers who don\\'t arrive 3-4 hours ahead This is the error message: Paper tickets cannot be serviced on-line. Please see a JetBlue Crewmember for assistance. CCNDJP/ I can send a screen shot of the systems error if an email address is provided Inconvenience is an understatement. More like torture. Clearly going down the wrong path, JetBlue. don\\'t just cling on to the safety card. It safety was really an issue, then flight would have landed immediately. . I waited in line all that time to be told by a crewmember that there\\'s no update until 9:30 #3HrDelay #disappointed Phone agents can\\'t see same flights I see online??? Can\\'t change tickets even when I am paying. Very frustrating #jetblue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi? Denver-Boston 2/10 flight 994 and Boston-Denver 2/15 flight 493 (both planes!) visible snack crumbs on seats on all upon boarding Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we\\'ll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/ I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate attendant told us 3-4 :( Well being on time is not going to happen now. Safety does come 1at. Looks like I\\'ll have 2 look 4 another flight now #1stTimeFlyer U said 15mins to Take Off and now we were told 1hr more delay &amp; possible Cancelled Flightlation. How do U plan to rectify this? #Frustrated I hope so. Wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but it\\'s too Late Flight for that! no updates on anything! All we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked. flight 99 to DCA 2 delays, I\\'m all for erring on the side of safety but it\\'s an inconvenience to people with connecting flights!! it\\'s ok. Things happen. Just very frustrated when you have to change your schedule. See you tomorrow for a new rescheduled flight. I had a SJC to JFK departing 10:55pm tonight. I have to now change my whole schedule. Can we get a sort of refund for this? your airline should have a better system to Inform your clients when their flights are Cancelled Flightled last min. 😒👺 we have schedules too the slowest boarding process I\\'ve ever experienced and rude customer service agents. needs to get its act together in #PHX - Yes. Best case scenario I get my gear Late Flight Friday, early Saturday. Camp starts at 6AM tomorrow #toolittletooLate Flight - In CA for the weekend to attend a training camp; thanks for sending all my gear to FL; looks like this trip is a waste #nothappy why are you making me stay in JFK until 2 am or Late Flightr? Just let me rebook without making me pay more and stranded passengers aren\\'t being helped to get another flight? why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!? I\\'m sitting on the plane. Too many predictable mechanical problems. Still onboard. This is getting bad... on your 1503 flight JFK to PR. They got the doors open on this frigid temperature. #icyflight #poorservice #poorcommunication #waitingsince 10:51 for bags frm flight 424!!! #jetblue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It\\'s comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr the one man in baggage office says \"I dunno\". HELP where is our luggage?? Flight 424 has been waiting an hour for bags! #jetblue #poorservice what is going on? We arrived at 10:51pm Not One Bag Has Been Unloaded!! Flight 424 service for baggage at JFK is incomprehensible. No employee knows where our luggage is frM flight 424 LAX to NYC ITS AN HR WAIT NOW yes of course, before I left the airport. I kept looking but claim is still open. #669 stewardesses can\\'t work w/o a galley light! Back to NYC to change a light. #fromthefrontseat #jetblueBlues why do you have every channel but How are and I supposed to watch Scandal? But free FlyFi is sweet! I left my apt 10hrs ago to go from Boston to SJC and I\\'m still NYC. Please bring back the nonstop flight. #jetblueBlues What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet? we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv\\'s on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email... the pilot just stated that after 22 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this. #gettingoffplane we now have to get off of the plane and wait another 1-2 hours for someone at the to read the temp. #tired I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac after 40 mins they tell us they can\\'t check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it\\'s back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail time to reevaluate my nyc carrier. what\\'s going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr. I\\'ll be lucky if I\\'m home by 3am how come you\\'re responding to everyone else and not me #wtf what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages. I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately my butt hurts. that\\'s what they told me half an hour ago I have been hanging here for almost an hour took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now. it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others? delayed flight bummer well, we\\'re on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. 😔 what is happening with the flight from FLL to SFO? Why the delay and the reroute? shut up an turn on the tvs/music If your confirming to me that the rate won\\'t go down again looks like I can\\'t fly JetBlue this time around, can\\'t afford that price :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn\\'t feel safe. Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn\\'t book right away due to all the snow; I\\'m in BOS. I don\\'t want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice! Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight... all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I\\'m looking for something a little more specific. if I\\'m about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed. can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They\\'re saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are... walked from the gate to the just ask desk by gate 1 on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach? you service agents at MCO are great, but their are not enough of them working right now! not to get into semantics here but \"by\" means \"within the extent or period of; during\" and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary is giving me false hope of ever getting home not cool to announce a flight \"delay\" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering no help. what\\'s the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should\\'ve taken place 30 minutes ago. now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What\\'s wrong with you guys?? Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site. that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled. I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there? no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans I can\\'t do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can\\'t do that time! My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help! Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can\\'t be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you? Landed at MCO before 9am and still don\\'t have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney\\'s Magical Express this AM.I am livid! Flight 69 (ha!) - one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left. I just want some warm weather! I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I\\'ve had with Jet Blue. You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn\\'t have email or telephones. Right? Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn\\'t resolved? No, it didn\\'t all work out. I called Jet Blue from Mexico to address the fraud alert with Capital One on the line. Rebooked. actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone? I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept. When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert. But jet blue had Cancelled Flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it. has screwed me over for the last time. glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService Alternatives? You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers. 8 years. No more. I\\'m done. Pooling and gifting are completely different. I shouldn\\'t have to be charged $375 to send points. Its disgusting. Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone? doesn\\'t help if I have to fly on specific days it\\'s noting about me i m perfectly fine it\\'s the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate. i am sharing it to the public. I fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll. Your staff is the worst i ever met. what\\'s up w flt 4? Brothers fiancé sitting on board for 30mins w tech issues. is giving us free movies because apparently the dunkin donuts coffee is a safety hazard. #thingsyoucantmakeup #switch2SBux? As long as someone remembers to put it on plane right? That was a really lame excuse.Geez can do much better #coffeeneeded What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn\\'t relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee What\\'s up with lack coffee on 7:30AM flight. Was told someone forgot to load coffee onto the plane. What????? #INeedCoffee dont get me wrong i love flying with you. Tv, free bags and descent fares. The recent plane problems are just annoying. i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer. Hey guys! Your Flight Booking Problems system ran my first and middle names together at time of Flight Booking Problems. Is that going to be a #TSAnightmare ? - He Cancelled Flightled a flight &amp; was given 2 weeks to apply travel bank credit to another flight &amp; credit was transferable How is travel bank credit issued by your company fraud - I acquired credit from family friend Charles Kravitz - see his account talked to a manager and she offered we pay 3X\\'s in cash what we originally paid #nothanks #jetblue #ripoff #flyunited .@JetBlue 😂😂😂😂😂OMG. Bored &amp; read through this convo.. Seems like JetBlue is on point. Cancelled Flightling tickets for 3 best friends going on vacation and never told us #jetblue #fixthis #ripoff Apparently the pilot had made some announcement about engine trouble and losing fuel too quickly. trying to charge us $550 dollars cash for tickets we paid for months in advance #isthisreal #nevertoldus #jetblue #NeverAgain please get service started at and offer good routes lile florida upstate ny vegas etc Cancelled Flightling flights, sending out tickets, then not telling the buyer... #jetblue how is that allowed? i am here - what is your resolution? not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can\\'t assign me a seat? My Flight 1318 is delayed and I am connecting from Boston. Is it possible to switch me to Flight 118 so I can make my connection? loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited tickets were confirmed and sent out. find out today that they Cancelled Flightled our tickets months ago and never sent an email #jetblue would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #NeverAgain rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport I\\'m on flight and no booze being served 30 min in... What gives? #lostrevenue #angryandsober #bachelorpartymishap I\\'ve used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again. managers telling us to write a letter because we\\'re upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls. customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won\\'t be flying you. Point system is almost a sham. ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid I spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. I want my confirmed flight to be taken care of does it look like to we talked to customer service? claims w/ customer protection they \"will notify customers of delays, Cancelled Flightlations and diversions.\" #NotTRUE if there is a \"processing error\" the why do you send out full flight tickets and confirmations? #FlySouthwest tells me $130 paid &amp; confirmed flight will now cost me $566.80 CASH ONLY airport 22 hours before my flight #RIPOFF #NoSupport = WORST. Booked in Oct. w/ email confirm &amp; NEVER INFORMED Cancelled Flightlation. Instructed \"to mail written letter\" No, he didn\\'t have more info. I was more infuriated by the way previous rep treated me. how she can possibly work as a JetBlue rep? she hung up before I can get name. She took no accountability for keeping me on hold +20min. Next rep was not able to track name the free wifi makes up for the television not working... It\\'s staticy #ithelpsabit I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY?? is flight 51 on 4/24/15 moved back? When I booked it said we arrive 11:31 but now it says 12:08 😢 case making jackass out me we not allowed do favor say?get right care less!me no out of vacation now true see!am!peter scott False - agent let us do an extra leg room upgrade for $ but not upgrade to mint. Poor business practices. #badcustomerservice tried them not helpful. Really dissatisfied with Flight Booking Problems my whole trip with jet blue this time around besides the flights. rqstd upgrade to mint at LAX and was told no because i used points! Why turn down $1600 bcz I used points? #trueblue trading customer experience for short term $$. So sad for this (previous?) loyal customer. flight 577 fll to sfo. No speed line even though I paid for it. No coffee on flight. and my non stop now has an unscheduled stop Why wasn\\'t a $15 service credit voucher I received for tv not working accepted on my next flight for a pillow? CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I\\'m actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now. is it your standard protocol to call security onto a plane for a crying baby? Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today. Found someone to ask. No answers. Landed almost 40 minutes ago. Flight 1951. Bags haven\\'t come and we landed 30 minutes ago. Gnight checked in at POS &amp; supervisor was unaware of policy. That sucked having to guide him to the internet. He was v unfriendly 2 hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer? Nah, I\\'m good. your customer services agent Jorge at Orlando International is rude and disrespectful, I never want to deal with your bullshit ever If it was simply a minor mechanical, why would they say that? can you tweet #closepwcs to get the word out?😢 My mother had overheard a personnel ask the attendant if \"the passengers really knew what was going on\" and the attendant said no. What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time. it says it is now 9:58 you owe me I want you to pay for my parking fee at Orlando airport because your app told me my moms flight landed at 9:19 and it lied They told us 10 minutes almost 40 minutes ago. 1472, FLL to LGA. This is getting old. 4th flight in 2.5 weeks, 4th significant delay. I just submitted feedback for you Not a good way 2 handle baggage or customers: I was believing you for a minute, but we just got delayed for a 3rd time! Delay = Perfect time to learn Swift programming with I put it my \"to\" and \"from\" airports, click update and it tells me to put in my \"to\" and \"from\" airports. Why doesn\\'t your \"Best Fare Finder\" work? third JetBlue flight in less than a week. All Late Flight not for weather. Reliability going downhill. This is how you have me feeling.... why is the buffalo flight so Late Flight? u suck Big Donkey Balls! waiting for flt 105 to Chicago. Why hasn\\'t aircraft left buffalo yet? I don\\'t think I\\'ll be testing those waters out on my own dime again. C\\'mon now. My flight\\'s delayed annnnnd you can\\'t give me a pick?!? I\\'m about to tweet at or ....... Flight is 100% full. Walked down the hall to Carousel 8...found all bags sitting there. Still no words from crew...signage still not updated Headphone jack not working on my flight. Tried...considerable confusion...no announcement...no sign updates #JetBlueBOS What\\'s up with luggage for Flt 790 DCA-BOS? Pax waiting for 30 min for bags...no show. Carousel 6 signs not updating. I had 2 fight 2 get a credit for the value of my bag but I got it. #skytrax #jetblue #corpgreed #nevertakeno They did not have any &amp; asked if I wanted tea. How do you have tea&amp;not coffee? I\\'m a gold on United &amp; coffee I nvr think 2x about : ur Wed BWI-BOSTON flights (8pm) really need to be better scheduled! They are almost always delayed! I\\'d fly to an airline who actually gave a crap about its fliers outside of generic apologies. Jet Blue is terrible #jetblue the big board says we aren\\'t leaving until after 8:30 😩 while I appreciate that you actually responded I travel way too much for you to tell me coffee is not a basic option my dads vacation to SXM got delayed a day because of shoddy service. Earliest FLL &gt; SXM flight? trying to hep him out I did not report the updated info - don\\'t know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number. Whoa! No tag and you still saw my tweet. Flight 105 JFK to Chicago. Trying to get home to see my little brother wrestle! so why do you put this at the bottom of ur baggage report? For fun? #JetBlue #skytrax if u want to be helpful save me the trip from Westchester Cty to JFK, plus parking - my info is in the photo I am heading to JFK now just on principle alone to deal w my lost &amp; damaged bag. #jetblue #jetbluesucks #jfk #badservice #fail u now have my gears grinding. The JFK baggage office told me I need to bring the bag back right now if not they will close my claim U say our safety is our highest priority but that doesn\\'t extend 2 our property? This is totally nuts. glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that\\'s the best answer u have? is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can\\'t accommodate guests like #NeverAgain PR-friendly tweets don\\'t help drive accountability. Hope Mr. Hayes takes note. Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended! only w/ $70 upgrade. Unsure why she can\\'t just switch someone around. I called 24 hrs in advance for this reason. keeps asking me to enter a valid email address. My info is saved and has worked hundreds of times before can\\'t change it. True blue points and I can\\'t get to a phone should\\'ve been on one of your flights instead... has now lost our bags to add insult to injury I\\'m trying to add my 2012 flights to my Badges account but i don\\'t see an option. Help plz? I cheated on you, and I\\'m sorry. I\\'ll never do it again. has given my wife and I the worst start to a honeymoon ever lots of people scratching heads and looking at screens ignoring passengers what\\'s going on with 1171 LGA-FLL..poor to no communication from gate agents?? FYI - your android app is set to not be applicable with the Nexus 6 - please fix (its a phone, not a tablet). Cheers! our #FoodAllergy community. IF you want our continued loyalty, you need to do better than that. Perhaps some training is in (2/3) insensitive? #FoodAllergies are life-threatening. Unsolicited UNEDUCATED opinions are inappropriate, reckless &amp; dangerous to (1/3) Oh no! I thought it did. :( nope. None to be found I may need to. I had a 40 minute layover and now have a 15 min delay on my first flight. I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here. extra-speed line closed in Tampa. What gives? would love to respond to link but supervisor tore ticket up and refused to give me names and hid her badge from me you respond to my friend but you can\\'t respond directly to me you wanna help out? How about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose. but you guys should know that musicians are very sensitive about the safety of their instruments when flying. For good reason. ask but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers. loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w/ customers. Just ask NOLA musician about that. #shameful Call was not made by the inflight crew. They in fact asked us why we didn\\'t bring it on. last week I bought a plane ticket round trip to FL &amp; just 4 fun I look at the price of them today and they went down! #nothappy Only middle seats. SFO -&gt; BOS. Not fun. She keeps getting $10 credits. Would much rather have a working TV. Disappointed we weren\\'t allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane. Not cool. maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn\\'t moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza Third flight in a row for my wife with her TV not working... what is a personal email that I can contact? I have a complaint that you should know about WHAT\\'S UP WITH WEBSITE CAN\\'T ACCESS FLIGHT INFO you are missing the point. The flight left an hour Late Flight. Why are you allowed to be that Late Flight, and still charge me $50 and 10hrs? 2nd time flying jetblue this year and my armrest TV controller doesn\\'t work agian!!and that\\'s the main reason I fly jetblue 😔😓😤 It\\'s on me, That\\'s not what you said last night, though... :( the two of you should team up to serve cinnabons on the flights!!!! #BonsInTheSky hey you guys remembered lol! But now my BOS flights delayed... And turn the heat down in T5 it feels hotter than PR. spoken to 2 reps. Once I\\'m allowed to check my bag and through the TSA checkpoint, I guarantee I will be talking to someone. and the 20min line I stood in to drop my bag off? got txt 40min after sched dpt, saying plane had just arrived JFK. Late Flightr txt w/ dpt gate change. Then 9:04 dpt for 7:40 flight. I was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that I was running 10min Late Flight for. Turns out it left over an hour Late Flight. my son left his iPad on flight 1401 from JFK to FLL on Monday. I called and left message and have no heard back. Seat 25A. all taken care of .... Other then the dropped call and the total half hour wait #love #jetblue you stood me up last night, but I\\'m giving you a second chance. I\\'m just a boy, tweeting an airline, asking them to fly him home. waited for 15 min then got disconnect is I can\\'t make changes on the website am I still charged 25 dollars for using phone your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess just a heads up, this page no longer exists wonder if that\\'s the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly? they say they have no update. I don\\'t work I don\\'t get paid. Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh! no news here at the gate. What are my options? well I\\'m glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport. No place else I\\'d rather be (not) no ... I am guessing I have to call someone why 730 and not 645 as scheduled? #1408 IAD to JFK still hasn\\'t boarded. What\\'s today\\'s excuse and how am I gonna get to work? why is t that every time I fly jfk even more speed doesn\\'t work waiting for 10 min #nogood Clients got ZERO, in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed. not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable.. We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things. People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight. I understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out Late Flightr that night but only one of us got to take it disappointed that my flight back to boston from PR was Cancelled Flightled,rebooked 4 the next day,delayed that one too, and no compensation She claimed that she did, but I was not happy with the way I was treated. ripped my suitcase. I then was yelled at with attitude from Geraldine, your employee at the baggage center.Worst airline= #jetblue shout out to the crew on flight 89 headed back to the big apple, they kept my glass half full the whole flight! #jetbluejfk That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I\\'ll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting. the gate agent said our original plane got de-icing fluid in the engine that created a short so they took the plane out of service 6 hour delay. Supposed to land at 9pm now it\\'s 3am. Still not boarding. #EpicFail I hope your system wasn\\'t hacked cause someone else\\'s passport info was on my reservation &amp; I couldn\\'t get my boarding pass honestly I’m glad you didn’t Cancelled Flight the flight, just that I’ll be driving home at 3-4 am now. :/ bag just delivered and items have been stolen. At first look - my Kate spade bag and bottle of spiced rum! Wtf!! I\\'m disappointed my flight was Cancelled Flighted, mostly because I was excited to listen to the song \"I\\'m Blue\" while flying on JetBlue. flight delayed 3x(!) and still not taking off on time, &amp; greeting me at my seat (yes it\\'s gum &amp; garbage): bag is supposedly here in Boston I don\\'t know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that\\'s where we had all the changes to flights I get Sunday due to weather and ok Monday they\\'re busy but this is crazy supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided! offered to pay for tix at the airport BC we were never told that our reservation didn\\'t go through. Was told I could pay $2275 pp. right now completely pissed off I\\'ve had no shampoo, no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat my SIL bought tix for us to NYC. We were told at the gate that her cc was declined. Supervisor accused us of illegal activity. dispatcher keeps yelling and hung up on me! now when I call it\\'s still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight they couldn\\'t do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after 6pm then today from 11 to 3 then from 6 to 8 flight from DCA to BOS has no heat #OhNo #BundleUp #Leastthebeverageswillbecold “@JetBlue: Unfortunately that\\'s not an available option with our current system. Sorry guys. That\\'s a certain #fail Fix it plz. received horrible customer service at LAX on 2/11. Reservation Cancelled Flighted without notification, despite having confirmation number. flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I\\'m entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued? Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :( Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks! well, your new baggage fees, fare structures and reduced legroom has turned you into every other hated carrier in the US. Congrats yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves. that\\'s not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would\\'ve made the change earlier if given accurate info. well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2 tell your employees that! even responded quicker via Twitter when they #fail.... Still on hold, hoping no one books the flight..... #fail ah yes. Put the bags on the floor instead of the overhead bin so no one trips. #safetyfirst #sarcasm where exactly can I leave a note Guys, really bad #fail . Someone better call my wife back to get this handled. 203-382-3312 while she waits on hold.... #fail My wife on the phone asking to switch flight times. In mid switch gets disconnected. Now Cancelled Flightled! No new time! No call back they tried to have us towed. Do you think I\\'ll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official ticket issued whilst delivering your customers. understand that, but this policy of targeting your passengers is not good for business and should be addressed with security Always been a fan but maybe next time I\\'ll fly for real customer service. understood ... but could I go and put myself on the standby list 5 hours prior to my flight? the whole plane. Hoping for better luck on the return flight Sunday. so I\\'m penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat? dropping passengers with small baby and 3 infants at your San Juan terminal. As unloading baby, officer writes me ticket for $75 the TV. Wifi was spotty. It\\'s just a nice feature for a X country flight. Still won\\'t keep us away #lovejetblue so technically I could drive to JFK now and put in. Request for tomorrow\\'s flight? why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional. we were on b6 619 this morning from Boston to beautiful San Diego. We really were bummed the satellite was broken. :( just lost my business Enjoy your profits I would drive 2 1/2 hours to jfk to board JetBlue to Vegas instead of closer Hartford airport. Cramming more seats on plane.NO MORE yes, today. Flight is full now. They said no to me at gate :( this is not a flight delay this is horrible planning on Jet Blue!!! #jetblue insane the craziness I\\'ve seen with Jet Blue today at Newark Delayed 3 hours and now we are waiting for a Pilot!! #jetblue we are delayed, until he arrives the highlight of being delayed #freeconcert whose performing at T5 flight 894, first officer not even at the airport wow!!!!!! Unreal, staff waited until we all boarded to announce we are delayed. - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success. yes, 3 times. I need some one to call me and help me change a flight. I can\\'t do online. Thanks. pls send an IT tech 2 baggage office. Poor guy is trying 2 print my claim &amp; can\\'t. I need 2 get home. Upgrade 2 printers MFPs dropped 3x in past hour Ive called you 3 x &amp; waited on hold 10 min each time to be disconnected each time. Enraging! I need to speak to someone! #help any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn\\'t explain delay. pls find my bag, I need 2 get home! Very frustrating. Hope my bag is somewhere in Leaving the #jfk w/o my luggage. tried calling multiple times, i just wait and when it finally connects i get hung up on Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then \"mailbox has not been set up yet.\" Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C\\'mon But if customer service ment anything to you.... you would try. Quoting policy is never effective customer service. Apparently not. why are we delayed :( flight 1601 continue button generated a trip to \"plan your trip page\" regardless of how far along I was in Flight Booking Problems process hint: the end of it remember - I\\'m very doubtful and not very hopeful :( I\\'ll give u a chance but I don\\'t think I\\'ll fall for it #backtodelta be responsible for replacing it new stroller. The travel credit doesn\\'t help cover the cost of a new stroller. Your crew ruined it and therefore should I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a heard about the charge for 1st bag and tighter seats - no need to be a loyal JB customer anymore! Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight\\'s been delayed several times for my parents and i\\'m not receiving any alerts. hard to tell, but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane. just learning about your famous apology in social media marketing. Is Twitter an asset for Jet Blue now? I normally ❤️ you, but this Late Flightst flight experience was the worst. 2 hours on runway, no wifi &amp; tv not working properly It doesn\\'t matter who you directed me to. It\\'s the principle of the matter. When I gate checked the stroller it was 117 days maybe. figured but delay is listed at almost 2 hrs. Thanks for being great! Cheers glitches on website re: Flight Booking Problems travel &amp; checking in. Nothing between ur site &amp; the airport was communicated, it was a nightmare. as much i have paid in fees. Plus hotel and food because of your changes i could had flown with a more reliable airline #no2jetblue Been dealing with a Cancelled Flightled flight since last night &amp; was booked to a 6:15 flight,wouldve at least liked to see Ella perform lol and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I\\'ve spent almost $500 they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC. should i continue? I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact. Got flight reschedule to flight form PIT to FLL and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour Missed my connect my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice busy due to storm but customer service should always be on point. More so now than ever #getittogether oh hell no. I\\'m not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people Is today\\'s JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it\\'s not... please provide me your direct email for me to explain. A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation. sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn\\'t be nicer is REALLY getting on my nerves !! 😡😡 #nothappy is there a better time to call? My flight is on Friday and I need to change it. Worried I may be on hold until then. and when will one of these agents be available to speak? just hung up on me again. Another waste of an hour of my time. How am I supposed to book a one way award flight? #badwebsite you\\'re killing me from the inside is not the new is more like the new Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents. flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can\\'t resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail always fun to get screwed out of an earlier flight (that isn\\'t full) #crummyservice #whydidntiflysouthwest #goodluckamericanair ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven\\'t boarded. I finally got through on the phone after a 2 hour wait time. Been stuck for 40+ minutes due to lavatory issues. No beverages. No snacks. No customer service. Flt 645 to PHO... #fail #refund I\\'ve been on hold to change a date on a ticket for over 3 hours. Can someone please assist me? Unacceptable. thanks 4 making it impossibly expensive 2 change 2 a flight leaving less than 24 hrs earlier than my reservation #1lesscustomer I cant get anyone on the phone to help with award travel.Purchased extra miles and 10 minutes Late Flightr the miles needed was raised. Why haven\\'t you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow. DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason. thanks for making me miss my meeting in Dallas. 700 dollars down the toilet 😊 I have two tight connections in #Charlotte and #Frankfurt Said only way to get on plane about to leave that would make my connection was a $75 fee. Instead of earlier, I am now Late Flightr! ur \"response\" was: my \"inconvenience was of no matter.\" U wanted me sit for 3 xtra nights in the city w/out comp! #donotflyusair Sadly I\\'m currently booked on one of your flights tomorrow that I will be changing if I can. standby so far for two of us. With snow storm hitting Iowa tomorrow we could be stuck here for two days. Why can\\'t I check in online for a flight tomorrow am? - been standing at the gate for 45 min trying to go standby bc I will miss my connection. No help! Do NOT fly US AIRWAYS! after being assured by the pleasant woman at gate B11 in Albany, NY that life\\'s not perfect, I\\'d heard enough. u didn\\'t bother following up, we booked with understands cust srv: provided lunch 4 delays &amp; upgraded seats! There is an error w/ my preferred status &amp; I\\'m not able to reach an agent via phone. Travel Friday. Need resolved - contact info? how does a pilot forget log book? Been waiting on plane for 45 mins!! #AlsoNoDrinkCartComingAround already did it. One person said they couldn\\'t do anything another said she didn\\'t know why the first person we talked 2 said that Over an hour on hold so far Nice, another delay with second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what\\'s next?? #USAIR #nothappy I want to love you! 43 minutes on hold! Help me understand why I switched loyalty programs. 59 minutes now. Nice customer service you got going on. 44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven\\'t spoke to a human. Never using you again. You have no idea how upset and frustrated I am right now. I\\'ll be sure to follow through with never flying with you again. how can a person go from number one on a standby list to number twelve in three hours? Should I be super platinum diamond status Forget reservations. Thank you to the great leadership at your company, I\\'ve Cancelled Flighted my flight. Once again, thank you. .@USAirways It was this saturday during all the snow in the DC area. Excited the flight was not Cancelled Flightled but sad he went missing. I love you guys &amp; I\\'m gonna let you finish, but I\\'ve been on hold for 1 hour trying to book a flight w/ my voucher. And, the helpful employee who changed her boarding zone so that she would have space for her pump is now being disciplined #fail Need to talk to a person about my bag. Waiting on hold for two hours. Bag s!b delivered last night. Online says not found. I don\\'t want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren\\'t medical equipment and that she should have \"planned better.\" - 800# referred me back to baggage services but I left the airport. I was on seat 17A - First impressions are hard to reverse. A horrible first experience with you. Will never fly with you again!!! not going as planned is an understatement. My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren\\'t for a family emergency, I\\'d Cancelled Flight. ...2 hours on the plane, they at least got us on a direct flight a couple hours Late Flightr on United sadly that didn\\'t help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!! .@USAirways I did but the more eyes I have looking for Pandu the better chance I have of bringing him home. my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped 167 minutes? \"Im not trained in that\". Cmon. Can\\'t you do better than that? any direct number to dividend miles account info? Every Time I try them I get actually hung up on trying to use chairman upgrade cert for flt 740 on 2/26/14 but being told not an option with 10 open seats? How? Thanks but I\\'ve been trying to call them since yesterday and I keep getting hung up on? Can you get me through to them?? an award travel ticket but cannot since it is under a different last name. I simply need to change it Ok thank you…I call from Spain to US for seating assistance! 2day: no coffee &amp; 1 working toilet. Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition. Coincidence? No #openskies I\\'ve been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate. Been on hold for over 5 hours! I believe I was overcharged $200 for my flight, I need an immediate explanation. HELP still on hold...1 hr 27 mins....thank god for chairman status. status match has the worst customer service. Can\\'t even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing. how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery! Shame on me this time! I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn\\'t arrive like they will call me? I\\'v been trying since yesterday and no one is answering... your CSR in PHL suck. Flt 3883 gets cx\\'d, i get rebooked to the next day? On standby for 4011. Not hopeful. HELLO!! Is anyone behind your twitter account? #badcustomerservice I keep getting hung up on. PLEASE respond so I can book a ticket with you. I won\\'t be able to buy one unless I speak to someone! hey!! Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS You should be prepared for Weather. All I want to do is find out if I can take train to PHL to catch my connection. When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your \"go to\" maneuver? Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed. This type of service in not acceptable. been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. charges a reasonable $50. i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online.... another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to \"bad weather\" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone? OK we are on DAY 11 trying to book a flight for 4. Ur system STILL says \"due to weather….call back Late Flightr\" #outofbusiness ? Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation. You all are the best for this. Could not have done it without you. our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating! Your policy needs a serious revision for babies. Fortunately I have choices and choose from here on out. still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service. they have all of this at hotels. Still don\\'t have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn\\'t fix the problem There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I\\'m flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC??? Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn\\'t been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst been trying for weeks no use should give me free baggage for this mess Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE. I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets seriously??? did you not see that I\\'ve spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours? R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature! 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q\\'d to take off. And we checked our bags. can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please. need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23. Horrible attitudes toward helping customers. Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever. why aren\\'t you updating flight status/delays? They\\'re also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you\\'re not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out nope, they just announced we\\'re headed back to the gate. pretty sure we didn\\'t actually take off at 7:10 well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I\\'ve wasted. I\\'ve got a job &amp; family this is crazy 5203 and we\\'re just sitting 20 feet from an open gate just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online what\\'s wrong with the plane? Flt 581 two broken airplanes, two days Late Flightr and I\\'m stranded after a funeral and missing out on my last semester of #college. 👍 Day 3 &amp; still no luggage Chkd STATUS=AWAITING ASGMNT TO DRIVER Since yest 10:15am Flight 830 CLT to Phl.

She said, \"because I told you to!\" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable! , since jan 22 have been on 10 flights. Why the disrespect in CLT, flt #2063 at 2:50pm on 18feb to DCA? just asked herba question nah it\\'s for my flight next week.. inside my Chairman 7-day window but you still haven\\'t released the last open First seat to me I\\'ve been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation. I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail Changing my flights with no explanations and still don\\'t have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service nope not yet... I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours. My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I\\'m supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought. Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn\\'t have done it without you. it\\'s not like I\\'m trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don\\'t want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU. some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love They\\'re flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $. thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer. it doesn\\'t take 6 days to respond to an already open case! are people going to answer our calls? pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail : You Make the Reservation; We\\'ll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail is utterly unreliable! They didn\\'t schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail yes but again valuable time has been lost I don\\'t like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I\\'ve been stuck in CA all day and should\\'ve been home by now. You owe me. yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am. the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH can\\'t get back lost time flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces. Ur fired - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution? my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don\\'t have it? Flight 719 2/22/14 thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can\\'t go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1 Hi. I\\'m in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare? Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death. A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period. I submitted a doctor\\'s note. I\\'ve never been treated this badly I\\'m glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems. Three months and my miles haven\\'t been credited. No one is going to read the email I sent. My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It\\'s been three months and my miles No one picks up the phone all day/ no opportunity to leave a voicemail Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open -- My request to merge the accounts is denied No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don\\'t want this blasting here. I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont\\' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card - I had 20,748 miles in my account and was informed I\\'d forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I - It\\'s all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I\\'m having screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn\\'t let me on the plane because we were (1/4) Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold not yet. But we will see shortly. I\\'ve flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words. flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help. honestly - how is it quickly as possible I\\'ve been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else. done it! Process initiated Saturday morning. Can\\'t get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage. How 2 get update?? yay for glitchy tracking system! My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said! really??? NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it\\'s 11:30pm #NoExcuses yeah I know that but that doesn\\'t get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens. Everyone is sorry. Don\\'t have what I need for meeting tomorrow. 140 charac. isn\\'t nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they\\'ll Cancelled Flight my whole flight. if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer? #disappointed terrible service Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove &gt; 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person, Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I\\'m a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues! - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account. my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person. cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service. #socialtantrum yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren\\'t anymore for tonight...not fun :-/ Well, that\\'s a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do? it is my fault but i bought online and i get twice why i buy twice it fault but i bougth ticket jfk to mccaren and usairways ++ US1799 CLT-&gt;SFO in first no desert, no snack basket. Incoming was on time ? What’s up? was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I\\'d seen was gone. Had to get supv. you are the actual worst. You have zero respect for your passengers. I\\'m officially done flying with you. has the worst customer service line. I\\'ve called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being. that wasn\\'t the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won\\'t let me process my request. SMH you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this. ... I f@$%ing hate you. travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks. well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable. yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request.. 50 mins Late Flightr nothing! Not good. On hold for over an hour. I\\'ve been on hold for over an hour. Not doing so well in the customer service department. #weak - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation? there are breastfeeding momma\\'s watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response :) #DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown &amp; I\\'ve fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today I\\'ve been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren\\'t showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold. I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain it\\'s no wonder you had to sell hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow. did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time. and - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys. #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously? Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow. 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers #NoService good luck trying to reach a human! Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins... #neveragain every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola. is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never. I can\\'t wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways. It\\'s very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don\\'t answer the phone I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help I have better Intel than she does! She said plane is due in at 630. Flightaware and your own app say 645 not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn\\'t departed. Too little, too Late Flight. You suck Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options. should, but didn’t. i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip what\\'s up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18? Nice customer service. very embarrassing. I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler. yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... 😉 what about the impossible connection that started this? I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight. 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them. and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits... please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS has me on my toes whether I\\'m going to make my flight back to Boston tonight need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose #rude Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight. #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold? is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened. well there is certainly nothing happening \"in front\" of the scenes. #Noaccountability #disappointing 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can\\'t get a response after a week. Unacceptable I will never fly us airways again. strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4. Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don\\'t have enough hours together. Fail yes, thanks but took forever as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news! horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn\\'t get on the 4:05 I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not? 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination. it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: &amp; being argued with. I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice. .@USAirways Have you just given up? .@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME. Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA) Your \"moveup\" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am... why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app? why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me that\\'s a lie. your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me. do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls! And you took away my 1st class seat. Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time. PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help! would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me. no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded. She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too. No help. #lostandforgotten I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here.

I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines. I checked in \"Standby for 1st Class\" only to find I am \"not on the list\". This merger is a pain. been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now. honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600????? only happened because u couldn\\'t get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags I will never fly again the exhaustion of traveling n runnin thru the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. I am in a state of shock. power trip. I felt completely threatened and unsafe and I am so angry. Derrick Bussey. DCA. Would like to reiterate that I was thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving Late Flightr than the original flight I was booked on. even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me. you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them this is no way to treat women. I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable. citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended. Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I\\'m so upset really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday. we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright the jetway because he felt I was disrespectful. I have never been treated this way particularly when I was trying to be a good c with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off what happens if it isn\\'t located I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don\\'t like being told how lousy your service is. you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before. cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx. please fix your reservations phone system. The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days! #goodgriefpeople I have a flight voucher/confirmation code but there is no where for me to enter it on your checkout page while Flight Booking Problems. Pls help 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down! just an FYI I\\'ll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got. you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly. customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I\\'m sure TSA would. I find it funny that responds but you don\\'t. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down. I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today. slowest baggage claim ever Don\\'t blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather. Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility too Late Flight. delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that\\'s true I never want to fly US Airways again how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that? im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr. you guys lost my luggage US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr. US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances. thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn\\'t get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen! thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x US 728. One water run of the planet\\'s smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment. US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet\\'s smallest water bottles. US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us. US 728 returned to gate to get \"MEL\" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone? I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment. US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard. US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we\\'re not hearing from pilot for long periods. Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I\\'ve ever been in. No leg room! #dividendsmember One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won\\'t be any good publicity... US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange. my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic \"sorry\" email back take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules. back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn\\'t help. One person in front of me 20 min wait again? So you understand why I\\'m resorting to Twitter: No help available at gate while this occurred or by phone afterward. going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please! I\\'m expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box. what\\'s the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac? stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help. You can do better than that. really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx. well that is not going to help. I\\'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he\\'s elite wAA hi. You lost my father\\'s wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me. 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go. is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them. yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on. Row 16, flight 634 today if you\\'re looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need. seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground! I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers. why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn\\'t know when we\\'ll leave. anyone there to help? Still on hold... oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest. site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX. is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given. flights &amp; \"customer relations\" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents! - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry now on hold with customer care. Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm. when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information. lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA. your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time. usually \"sorry\" doesn\\'t involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that\\'s a club perk. don\\'t worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold. Sorry #minefits horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn\\'t work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody... now my rebooked connection is delayed. I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!! And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered? any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online? takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail how long for a reply Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover? And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways how do I get a hold of customer service? I\\'ve called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I\\'ve been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane .@USAirways Can\\'t book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help? / was the worst experience I\\'ve ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me? grrrrrrrr. Couldn\\'t book a flight via calling either :( delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077 Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever. she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best! When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person... Your system is affected by the weather? how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating I\\'m unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven\\'t heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates?? / don\\'t forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail hey since you f*%#ed my wknd can I have day pass to admirals club or meal coupon or free coke? {blank stare} : You Make the Reservation; We\\'ll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail I listed my baggage claim number. Have them call me, my number is on the ticket. I had to use Lady Speed Stick this morning. Another dead end. They only handle AA L&amp;F. They gave me the same failed # I already had. 610-362-7498(99) VM full. #lost Houston Gate 17 customer Service needs to treat people with respect. There are hardly people waiting! #chillpill #usairwaysfail what\\'s going on with your website &amp; mobile app??? Help!!! We have submitted the customer relations form and await your response! That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail I\\'m sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times thanks for a subpar travel experience and it\\'s not even over yet #stepitup is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls no you call me. they told me to call back Late Flightr i will be Cancelled Flighting my us airways credit card and choosing other airlines after my experience this week.

Any help is appreciated. thanx but this isn\\'t my first rodeo. Done &amp; done yesterday. No results or comm, unless u count status: bags lost &amp; claim filed. can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I\\'m staring at empty overhead room. or how about power outlets at your seat if you\\'re gonna keep us siting here forever? I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me. What is going on with flight 1826 from PHL to PHX? 10 mins to estimated departure nobody has board and no update. but my bag is still missing Seriously doubt that as I am still sitting inside at the gate.

Wife and I flew to Italy recently. Bought tickets via Finnair, flights operated by USAir. Didn\\'t get dividend miles credited. 8 hour delay pho-mia, your airline is bad and getting worse, Foolish for american to merge. You treat your customers like crap 28 hours Late Flightr still no email. work supervisor needs documentation to approve last minute vacation day request 3 hours on hold got rebooked on a new flight yesterday. I asked for a new itinerary/confirmation email to be sent here\\'s to sitting on hold for 4 hrs flight Cancelled Flighted and they disconnect twice. #fend4urself #stranded #diverted Cancelled Flights flight Tampa to Philadelphia today due to runway conditions yet tonnes of USAirways flights landing there today, explain! your phone system is not working at all I have been bumped again so now I am at 3 times I need to get out of mco no my flight plans have been delayed until tuesday due to your computer crash 4914 from PHL to BGM. I cannot believe this has happened 2x in under two weeks! \"ma\\'am the doors close 10 mins prior to departure\" \"but I was here 20 mins before?!?\" laughter from the 2 agents at 9:05am after the plane left: \"why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?\" I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can\\'t get through. You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use! me after arriving at 8:41am for a flight scheduled to depart at 8:57am. doors closed, no agents I need to speak with a live person. I\\'ve had it with the recordings. I was told on Sat that we\\'d have our luggage by yest. thx for delayed checkin on noon flt to mia then forcing me to take Late Flightr flts which were delayed. Cincy to Miami in 13 hrs! #fast getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles. already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this. First the pilot was Late Flight, now it\\'s maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable. I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying.. - Burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning. you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date i worked with you and bought my own rental car when you failed to get me to the location i paid to get to and now.... I\\'ve been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. #unacceptable Discovered our flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday at 3:30PM - finally notified us our flight was Cancelled Flighted at 0316 AM I am appalled. My departure with you was all messed up and now on return i am supposed to fly alone with two very sick kids Will tweet all day until I get a live cust rep. I will make sure the world knows you don\\'t care about your customers health. Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed.

Please FIX this ASAP!! #freeflight I relied on US Airways, and that was my mistake. Awful customer experience. Thank you. The website crashing for me. On hold 2hrs after my flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; \"Anthony\" was beyond rude and not helpful! they\\'re weighing you down. Will the nightmare ever end? Just found out our flight today is delayed due to \"ground handling delays affecting a prior flight.\" : When You\\'ve Got to Get There, We\\'ve Got Excuses! #usairwaysfail first, luggage got stuck in a different city, now I get them back today &amp; one of your employees stole a pair of gloves from me! sure knows how to pamper customers they strand abroad. #badcustomerservice #fend4yourself #youareonyourown : We Suck -- And Pass the Savings on to Us! #usairwaysfail Can you help me with a refund. the phone guy couldn\\'t help. The website won\\'t let me submit a reply. We take Late Flight to a whole new level! You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn\\'t have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you\\'re attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail hello??? Anyone there? forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA \\'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out\\' Airline flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #NotHappy then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!! so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren\\'t here 45 minutes Late Flightr wow, awful customer service. merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it. How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls? flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you. three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!? What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait. Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again. you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me. I\\'ve flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime. This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long😒 your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that. Go extinct. A merger only delays the inevitable What was the point of the merger? Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore? I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form. You guys are the best :) Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up. Recommend a call back feature. IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY??? SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR??? not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website. Can you help? how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems? Please don\\'t trivialize me. This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long? sorry doesn\\'t help. It\\'s midnight PST. How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line? Like I thought this was America. When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia? you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest. At least they treat their customers properly. But nope! Apparently this is the way you guys do business! I guess I\\'m flying southwest and her blue from now on. I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight. there\\'s over 50 people in line and only one agent! And by the way, I\\'m planning it while I\\'ve Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour! Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area. I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways. and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me! you guys are the worst airline I\\'ve ever dealt with. No notifications, no keeping customers updated. Terrible service hey guys! Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST! is the worst airline to ever travel with. has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled. Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don\\'t care????!!! now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep? who\\'s in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight the call hung up on me.. got this message on your site to call about my flight - just gave up after being on hold for 3 HOURS! #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!! yet again your staff in Philadelphia failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible Number or email? That\\'s the purpose of sending you a tweet? it still says that I can\\'t check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn\\'t left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights. had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh does anyone from your airline know how to do their job? Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time😡😡😡 denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg you reminded me today why I fly .... I\\'ve been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous you are the worst. making folks run from gate C29 to A18 to B11 with NO EXPLANATION and zero carts to transfer elderly and handicap. #PHL have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn\\'t happen... not given option for new flight! Why can\\'t we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever doesn\\'t let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in 5 hours Late Flightr only to get to PHL &amp; bag didn\\'t make it absolutely worst experience of my life at PHL. 6 hrs, 1 failed departure, 3 gates, and ZERO communication or help!! as soon as I call customer service to speak to a representative, I am disconnected have been trying to call customer service since 9pm. After an hour, was disconnected. Spoke to no one give us no information and an attitude. attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us now has stranded is in #Miami without updating any of the departure boards, and once they Cancelled Flightled the flight there was no... you are absolutely terrible at managing these delays... Been delayed and undelayed and delayed 6 times now. 10 AM office hours. have the most rude, unreliable, horrible company with equally rude, unreliable and horrible employees. Stay tuned. #PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing? flight #703 Philly -&gt; Mia? Bwahahaha! Delayed 5+ hrs, were in the air 30 mins then turned back around. #usairwaysfail I\\'m tired of paying for luggage &amp; less than stellar customer service #notafanofyourmerger have you heard about the debacle at DCA? What is happening with our New Orleans flight? #wewanttoknow I think it\\'s a little weak sauce you have zero inflight entertainment for a 4 hour flight from Salt Lake to Philadelphia we flew out, through and into good weather. when we landed, another technical issue with gate. improve service or lose customers - is stranding your customers, not reFlight Booking Problems them, and then not answering the phone the way you treat Platinum members? I made a reservation online but I didn\\'t receive any confirmation email. My bank said the transaction went through. Can u help? This is the worst flying experience of my life. Flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from Phl. 5+ hrs Late Flightr guess where I am? any update on this flight?It\\'s more than three hours delayed. Thank you. you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight???????? - you kind of screwed my day up, at least it was outbound, but you did save it by stranding me in a nightmare trying to get to Costa Rica from PHL today. Stuck in Miami and no one answers at 800 number. Ummmm I think US Air\\'s computers@were@down for hours - my flight is 3 hours Late Flight. comedy of errors continues...\" We can\\'t get into our gate, there is a broken down truck in the way\" #fail Instructions say to CALL. I\\'m just doing what it said to do.

That is your corporate policy? #usairwaysfail his name is Rett Cavan, he has a gofundme page, and is going to take his last breath tonight. This airline only cares about money that you would let us just switch to a different set of flights so we could spend time with the family after he passes away... he is 8 months old and is suffering from a rare form of cancer. Your customer service agents had no compassion and I am disgusted Best part was hearing the attendant give a voucher to person next to me for hotel at BGR. Then my guy saying \"we don\\'t do that\" horrible cust service exp at DIA today. Wife waited 3 hrs on the plane b/f flight 695 was Cancelled Flightled. Still waiting for bags. is really good at deferring responsibility. thank you so much for asking us to pay $700 to switch to a different flight so I could spend more time with my dying nephew. could not have had a worse airline experience.

I loved the 5+ hrs on hold along w 2 Cancelled Flightled flights I tried reaching out to you guys I\\'m running out time and patience I just want my flight to be honor and I want a confirmation! and after six hours even the gate agent got fed up and left us all on line in front of an empty desk. Stay classy US Air. how do you lose a pilot???? the ads on your phone systems when waiting for a rep is the most annoying thing ever especially when waiting for over 10 mins... we are missing our connection due to delay out of LAS. What are we supposed to do now? #695 might have been Cancelled Flighted? mechanical issue. 6 hours Late Flightr 100 people still waiting and Zero information. Please send help. 6 hours, no agent. Should I keep waiting? how hard is it to unload bags in order of arrival? 45 mins and counting for flight 699 is it policy to tell customers \"We can\\'t help you?\" I\\'m sorry but this is unacceptable thank you for correctly interpreting my last tweet as non sarcastic and delaying my flight again. YYZ Terminal 3 dance party? \"We can\\'t help you. We don\\'t put people up in hotels when you miss a flight it\\'s against policy.\" my friends at KPHL were told by your rep \"if it were me I woulda just gone home this am and tried again tomorrow.\" 1/2 wasted a day of my vacation after problems with not one but two planes... #waitinginphilly #flight838 it\\'s unacceptable the way your agents at the gate treat paying customers!!! more like USDELAY-ways.

Abysmal customer service 4097 DCA to BNA. Just told they need to do 1.5 hrs worth of maintenance. Was supposed to leave at 8:50 am. [sigh] why now just announce delay of 4478 from PVD when you knew captain was already on delayed flight coming in? Frustrating any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure this travel day sucks but Malcome K at gate 39 rocks. This guy is the brand you want to be. Replicate his approach and style. was on hold for four hours, never got connected.

I\\'ve been on hold forever so you\\'re not honoring miles with that were traveled last year? I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour? so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards &gt;250k miles on usair.

I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief. at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn\\'t fast enough the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to \"go left\" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami. -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect?

Your team needs to build capacity I will write CR. Not sure what good it\\'ll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible. -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won\\'t go-HELP!!! Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough fuck you. I\\'m dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever How dirty does the damn plane have to be to take an hour to get the plane cleaned??? Refund me my miles😡. #wasteoftime #theworst worst customer service I\\'ve ever experienced. I\\'ll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you. Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ? now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather? - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks Website won\\'t let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help. you were always my go to. What happened? Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service? trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins.

Is this SOP? figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke 45 minutes on hold no help transferred 4x pleeeeeeeease help! flight #3797 treatment of passengers has been atrocious - over 2 hours delay only to now deplane and given no direction only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That\\'s pretty awesome if you ask me... express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn\\'t help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing. i thought was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is the only decent airline out there? I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story! #Creditcardsales 13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands... US Airways website. So you double charge people when they book flights now? Apparently you have but I\\'ve never been booked twice Already tried.

We are sitting here. It\\'s just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA.

Now on the way home we were told we don\\'t have seats. Never flying again here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain it\\'s not misjudging it\\'s a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week. stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company. you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn\\'t even until June. will do. maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered yep, check it and my gmail \\'Promotions\\' folder regularly... :-( thanks for nothing 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let\\'s hope this plane works. I\\'m tired. Good info, but am already signed up for all options. None of which sound like they applied to the \\'missing\\' emails. is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight? and please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. \"Please wait\" then same form. found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times. Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I\\'m appalled. I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone. if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I’ll ride US for life nothing important to do. Why was I told to wait in the line? #patiencerunningout can someone please tell me who I have to talk to #getittogether #findurgrip Is it insulting that offer a \"non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip there is a travel advis for nyc and phil PA -winter weather- but U.S. Air hasn\\'t posted one yet.

Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up. How do I get through? who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck why I can\\'t book a flight to PRN through your website? this is ridiculous #planebroken can\\'t wait to board this one home 5 hours Late Flightr #neverontime #brutal #paymytab since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I\\'m confused since we had sunny skies I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help &amp; to call back Late Flightr.

Probably gonna miss the 4pm. I did, but i need to get a human being. What\\'s the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer. Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed! &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer. #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door! and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what? fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I\\'m stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009.

Huge inconvenience to travel plans. worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it\\'s \"not worth it\" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS see? No response? Obviously you think this \"service\" is acceptable. #customerservicefail “@USAirways: We\\'re sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone\\'s call and we appreciate your patience.” #false It wasn\\'t weather this morning. AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues. So far lost one of 3 days :( I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to and they keep sending me to you! no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don\\'t care how many points he has! He only has we have seats. on phone Iwas told I was getting error msg due to paid 1st class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right? waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim! flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me? yes but lost a whole day. Frustrating!! #poor customer service Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service. trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow. Tried computer, tablet, and phone. got error message on all devices? How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don\\'t match even though I can\\'t find a difference. yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag. Not happy with start of trip! Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice I\\'m glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available. I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists. Your systems don\\'t make it easy for the customer to access it. that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. Gave up I just want to find my bag so I won\\'t have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail Literally all that says is \"Case open\" What good is that to me? no you not sorry. I am trying 2 add a day 2 my vacation but there is a $200 charge just 2 change flights the two women workng PHL bag check term C 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect don\\'t bother wasting your time! will send u a form letter &amp; let u choose a gift certificate. #worstcustomerservice and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure. -not just this trip, been a few. Ur saving grace is ur cheaper flights. Now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines. horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I\\'ve since learned had one! delayed I\\'m charlotte big surprise Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could\\'ve handed this one better. same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fiancée are stuck in BOS! isn\\'t it funny that just apologizes, but doesn\\'t actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I\\'ll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA. We\\'ve been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn\\'t that have been done b4 we got on???? can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from perhaps. is a joke. Stop losing my luggage! I\\'ve been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what\\'s wrong?!? has no idea what customer service means. As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don\\'t treat me like its no big deal! Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares? how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707? I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI! I fly quite a bit, and it\\'s not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what\\'s happening, arrangements can be made Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I\\'m so displeased. headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more). I already let them know and sent 4 complaints. Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back # the flights weren\\'t from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I\\'m a platinum member with AA and feel like it\\'s worthless never let\\'s me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed. sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection I\\'ve been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! Thanks, but you can\\'t. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for \"maintenance\" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me. yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route. 835, fix this ASAP No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated.\" , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?! I\\'m logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal. are you fucking kidding me??? now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn\\'t help. This is terrible. what is the damn delay???? it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here app is the worst one for airlines. Can\\'t do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless. has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday! And also, it\\'s great that you tweet complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless. .@USAirways You\\'ll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again. thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day 4:30am for nothing! need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there\\'s a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours! that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn\\'t even pay for Choice well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on. I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable doesn\\'t seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn\\'t help #usairwaysfail this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight. the plane is moving and it\\'s no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open. nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn\\'t even pay. is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half. I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight. this is so unacceptable. I\\'m going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn\\'t even let us off. hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that???? yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we\\'re an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today. we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class. Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O\\'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We\\'ve heard it all! #LetsGo \"Able\"? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won\\'t fit overhead? is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue. is the worst!! Still haven\\'t left.. Everyone missing connections. today\\'s flight to Philadelphia. It\\'s a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it\\'s not even snowing in FL. I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven\\'t talked to a human. gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!! thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight. NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. .@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm. 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more! this response doesn\\'t correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience! it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due to mechanical. never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service. unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn\\'t be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time. I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven\\'t left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience. Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable. offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!! that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us that\\'s incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to \"choose\" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/ your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better. now the freezing bus is just doing circles? please explain, I have plenty of time since I\\'m STRANDED!! I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice. why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket? 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up? we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary. doesn\\'t want me to get home They don\\'t stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway? DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour! - I bet you don\\'t, but I\\'m the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you. I can\\'t even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket. oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving. Flight 1137 has been awful that\\'s the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge. never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays. my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help! the flight that I did not connect to was 1857. even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won\\'t be that difficult am sure #disappointed yes .not sure how you guys don\\'t know gate is occupied and keep us waiting Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment. - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I\\'ve come to expect. you gladly take the loyal customer\\'s money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused. the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people\\'s memories! You should be ashamed! 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service?? due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help! we can\\'t afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can\\'t afford to go home. ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded. thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives??? I already HAVE, four times 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you\\'re understaffed. I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do? Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail! Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn\\'t eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn\\'t need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can\\'t think@of even ONE. #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on It\\'s been 6 days. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways 5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested. Deal w this!! flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave! When will it be marked \"completed\". I\\'m scared I\\'m going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded. completed. If that\\'s the case then why does it still say \"in progress\" on Paypal\\'s website. I reserved on the 13th. Appreciate the calls when flight\\'s delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :) HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status. never fails to disappoint. platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can\\'t I check in for flight tomorrow? your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500. flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!! pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn\\'t just be throwing them on the cart. i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues should take a lesson from and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame.. they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today tells me to talk to about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight? this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything. 4420 delayed further? 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there. .@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full. 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 😡 over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member. yes. Every one of these on every flight is like this. There needs to be more Velcro or something please secure the \\'footrest\\' shelf\\' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay. Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew! FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don\\'t create policy. But it\\'s an undue penalty for a job req\\'ing flexibility why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS. not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I\\'ll keep you posted I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend\\'s wedding! #strandedattheairport how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :( poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more I\\'m not patient. I\\'m annoyed. If you can\\'t book this travel online, then you shouldn\\'t make people wait on the phone. still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please “@USAirways: Thanks for your feedback, Alan.” Thx, but no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt still waiting on a response - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can\\'t be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website. so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can\\'t sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed. but you guys switched me and didn\\'t inform me of the chathes worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice your app is bad, and you should feel bad. Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning. is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. I hope you can fix it yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home. has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible Will you be destroying lives in Eastern during this lively little event? For profits you will. 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn\\'t have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight. we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven\\'t changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane. 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people exec bene\\'s not honored Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy. a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y\\'all merged? My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times... No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable. over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck! some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative I feel sorry for AA there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!! what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! #flight1797 Stuck in Philadelphia airport for 32 hours due to \"maintenance\". Dreading my flight back home. Disgusting. I\\'ll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :( thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You\\'re an inferior airline. I\\'ve called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail. Please advise ASAP. they finally answered. They were rude and didn\\'t help me at all. I\\'ve been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled. Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god. On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can\\'t change reservation online. Sigh. #badcustomerexperience I\\'ve been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP? sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue? How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often... if you could change your name to and do what they do...that\\'d be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings. what\\'s the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight? got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA? Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours will these prices be honored? Ive waited this 1 1/2 hours on hold to make sure I can still get the prices I originally started what\\'s happening with 1217 Phl to LAX? Now 3 hr delay. Poor communication! will be stuck in PHX overnight. Service is getting worse. Flying southwest from now on. left us. had to stay on other flight until they got bags off. This sucks. Had to run with a baby and bags! 😂. Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour. another bad experience today. Frozen pipes on 597. Missing connection. of course! \"Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch\" it\\'s not the fact, it\\'s the attitude! never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone. found great prices thru US Air for honeymoon. Website wont work and been on hold for more than a hour now after being told 10 min we on on the flight from phf to clt. At the terminal but can\\'t get off plane yet. Need to get on iah flight. can we hold two seats for 11:35 flight from PHX to Las 1856 as this delayed flight 556 is not going to arrive on-time I\\'m a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st. I\\'ve been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt. I know you guys are busy but I think it\\'s time to higher more staff! yeah , I have been expecting The same for 3 hours i wish i was flying ... Cancelled Flightled our flights tomorrow and never notified us #FlyUS #Ripoff 502 M-phx Im still on The plane waiting And waiting I\\'m trying to merge my freq flyer accts but keep getting an error message and only a machine when calling the # provided. Help! our hold up now is the captain that was Late Flight...his bag doesn\\'t fit. that\\'s it?!?!? they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. Please explain this issue? My booked seat ended up being the last row which was labeled \"do no occupy\" had to play musical chairs for 30 mins. Unacceptable phone support rebooked but orig flt was Late Flight. Made it! let\\'s say it\\'s directly correLate Flightd to the chance of a replacement case. I know which would cost the airline less! I do to as I have an afternoon Conference in Las Vegas and I would rather plan ahead than run thru the airport and then attempt will try.. Now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883) I thought about moving a lot of business over too, but first impressions count.. Glad it was miles and not cash. on flight # 556 delayed#connection help for flight # 561 # help via email hey just letting you know you\\'re the worst fucking service I\\'ve ever used thanks for nothing [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her.

Can you help me? plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW. The 810 PHL &gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight. Gonna miss the connection for \\'s 40th #GTH239 i hate you it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems. Yes, understand non transferable understood and so does us airways. Getting through tsa is the problem I paid for my seat. I expect to be able to use my full seat if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse? #nothappy so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff the gate agent said \"it\\'s booked in full. Sorry\" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land. Empty 1st class, Chairman can\\'t move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again! you\\'re the only airline that\\'s not open sooner. It\\'s not a confidence booster. checked in last night airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen? new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can\\'t get through TSA cardholder is flying. We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating. this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent. 130am flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights.. thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account.. a long, incredibly frustrating day no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn\\'t have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help Been dealing w/ to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the merger. #USAirways I didn\\'t Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags : i was told my ticket expired but i never recvd any notice before it expired .This sucks.i paid 40k miles &amp; $125 for the tckt worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles? I didn\\'t take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn\\'t get in til 5 sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight. #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!! please go to a gate. This is absurd. 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported. lost our luggage. #yay really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?! Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help : i have been trying to reach dividend miles to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her My flight finally arrived in Charlotte. They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me. What a mess been on hold for over an hour, still don\\'t know where my bags are, won\\'t refund me my flight?!?! It wasn\\'t weather!! no your not! My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I\\'m dumb and should be using a different airline #wth you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it\\'s middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient. delays to the max well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy it shouldn\\'t take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details. Called twice and disconnected. Emailed them a week ago and still nothing... I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! does not! help! yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE still waiting! Captain reports he\\'s called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa. you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done I have been doing that all day. Can\\'t find my bag anywhere bc they\\'re saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX. why no ground crew at DCA when we\\'re already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr being told \\'tough break and this is how it is\\' is unacceptable. You can\\'t even tell me when my bags will be here now telling me I don\\'t have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!! Your software is broken. \"Call Customer Support\" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers. It\\'s not double booked. I spoke with CS and we\\'ve got a plan to fix this. It\\'s still an amateur mistake that should never happen. hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit? delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I\\'ll probably be taking my business elsewhere. ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa. I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight? so far I\\'ve gotten six different answers Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double. what\\'s going on? I\\'ve been hearing a not-friendly \\'Please wait\\' on repeat while I\\'m on hold, being transferred to idk where... The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around. That\\'s not good. I\\'m sorry as well. It\\'s been 24 hrs without my bag and I can\\'t get a straight answers. I\\'m on call #6 for today. Ya\\'ll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs. I wish we were on our way. Now there\\'s a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we\\'ll be taking off. if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn\\'t be stuck in horrible CLT now. you run a piece of shit airline!! Thanks for ruining AA “@USAirways: We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.” Confirmation code? Finally back on board. Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us? sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting. I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please pass along my feedback. I\\'ve tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :( Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly. PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier. That\\'s so wrong I\\'m delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga. Not good we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool she missed her uncle\\'s funeral, and you \"hope\" they can find another flight. That\\'s very considerate of you. My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I\\'m very disappointed. just lost a faithful customer. I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins. Now flight further delayed. Don\\'t lite a match either Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided. it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys well this is about as worthless as your regular service. A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn\\'t ready after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic that\\'s understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is! Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC. your app sucks balls compared to #USAirways So my flight was Late Flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to Phoenix thanks again last time I EVER FLY USAIR \"admirals club\" at CLT has rude, and ignorant front desk staff...@AmericanAir you have fallen so far...THANKS DOUG PARKER!!! to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats &amp; floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile I paid for my ticket on on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account. this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew? my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485 no they dont. I think I already said that. No one responds. Its an auto response. Wait is this an auto response?????? started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck us2118 My wife in Boston says no snow right now. I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don\\'t care you see now that is a lie. They auto respond with insulting email. #sucks how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it\\'s not actually snowing in Boston? Usair flight 2218 #US2218 I\\'ve been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering. You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again... I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again What\\'s the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don\\'t scan it for tracking? No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease you can\\'t even track my bag to see where it is. It\\'s like it\\'s disappeared. Can\\'t get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It\\'s been over a month since travel &amp; I\\'ve submitted twice online I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !! is there gonna be a better day to call? I\\'ve called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person. I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off. I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do? so mad I can\\'t even believe you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I\\'d like an answer. I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges I\\'ve done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don\\'t understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting. that wasn’t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you’re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) turns into with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn\\'t be more unhelpful. Why Yes but I will nvr fly w/ I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn\\'t see my father be4 they put him in a coma 40 minutes to put my TSA number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn\\'t get home until midnight. #NeverAgain the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone. would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold? would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation? would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold? a $100 - totaled. Not happy. Not at all. I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply\\'s #usairwaysssuck the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is \"I don\\'t really know what happened\" my number is 214-725-1966. CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks Have him call me. I cant wait to see if anything happens. Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! (although we\\'re not sure what a timbit is...) Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!! I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase. would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again? booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone? would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices. Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible that\\'s ok, just know that I\\'ll most likely never book with you again I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around. Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck I don\\'t mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn\\'t have had to. The airport has more room and you know.. food! That is appreciated. However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call. No need to reply, thanks. why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process? I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options Yeah I know that...but now I\\'ll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through. Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in \\'y\\'? There isn\\'t a ticket number...the transaction is still pending. do families no longer get early boarding with young kids? American, your new parent, gives it to us... not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41. your agent did not say no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy? It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself that link is broken. But if it\\'s the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information. Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I\\'m still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up stranded in Philly- #Starving and can\\'t get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue / next flight in 10 hrs On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min &amp; counting link doesn\\'t work and I\\'ve tried tracking my bag several times. Still doesn\\'t clarify where it is. Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly? All the people missed there connections and there\\'s only 2. Spend 1 HOUR on hold with . why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have a connection? last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged. No one answers the baggage call line for status? #chairmanlove this is crazy. Haven\\'t spoken to a human yet. There has to be a better way. you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance! I\\'ve been trying for DAYS! And I don\\'t get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts. What am I to do?? Why not have an option for a call back? I\\'m just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed. 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can\\'t even fix it. Worst service I\\'ve ever had I\\'ve been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really? A global company? Help! Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies. where\\'s my apology? Thank you. But it is sad that she couldn\\'t talk 2 a REAL person &amp; kept getting disconnected by an automated msg. flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called &amp; told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help? new tag line \"but we got you there alive!\" 2 days in a row I call and still can\\'t get anyone on the phone. Do you actually have any employees? Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$? Is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? Need help Flight Booking Problems an award flight. flight is delayed 5 hours. No reason given. Sure love flying with your airline. #whatajoke So we got her home, now we just need her bag. Is there a direct desk number for Savannah? I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren\\'t sure what city my bag was in. My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a \"sorry for your inconvenience\" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed 90 min delay thanks to \"maintenance issues\". Thanks for wasting a day. Not one to complain much but really 1 hour 15minutes and still nothing. Agents or Agent ⤵ thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways Hey! I booked a flight (Isabelle Gramp, Boston to LAX), and it said that it charged my credit card but the transaction didn\\'t go I\\'ve been on hold with your Divident Miles service desk for 45 minutes, and that\\'s after being hung up on the first time. is useless airways. Day 2 trying to get home on standby as a result of their Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways This is how vacations get Cancelled Flightled been on hold ⤵for 40+ minutes still havent talked to anyone. #failure for a response in 3-4 days? No thanks will never travel with you again. This is insanity. storms are inevitable but making us hold to just add a lap child #badservice any word on flight 1748 getting out of DFW in the near future? Stuck on plane at gate for over an hour little help to us! My husband has been on hold for an hour for something that take 5 minutes to complete. we might need a plane to get somewhere but just remember that you aren\\'t the only choice #makeovertime#customerserviceplease still can\\'t get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes has an SPF record error that is causing e-mail from noreply@usairwaysmobile.com to go to spam filters. DNS admin needs to fix! so the seat next to me (19B) on flight 1943 to Seattle has a tray table that is falling off... ,@USAirways 2nd time this occurred in 3 weeks. I\\'m not patient. I have no choice. #Antitrust issue my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone! Credit to my bank account for the two days of work that I\\'ve missed because of these Cancelled Flightlations. I don\\'t need to rebook I need to know the policy No reFlight Booking Problems necessary. I can\\'t afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. I would, however, like some type of credit. we\\'re all standing here and no one is saying anything. I\\'ll most likely be missing my flight to BWI AGAIN. that is the most useless tweet I\\'ve ever seen out of you. this is got to be the worst service I\\'ve ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed so you\\'re going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that\\'s part of the problem now over 2 hrs. Can\\'t wait anymore. 2 hrs for nothing. Now what?? #frustrated #USAirways I\\'ve called for 3 days and can\\'t get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn\\'t result in you hanging up on me? what is policy on changing flight to different dates once your flight has been delayed? why aren\\'t twitter and reservations connected? What do people want? Reservations, duh?!?! #usairways #unacceptable #holdtime REALLY?! what do I push to rebook with that 800 number tell the flight from clt to srq 5080 to wait!!!!!! they lost my bag baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera grades for this trip: Flight timeliness: 👎✈️ Cancelled Flightations: 👎😬 Customer Service: 👎😡 Flight attendants: 😊👏 Thanks means a lot after I was verbally cussed out, charged extra for a bag, &amp; then told \" I don\\'t feel like dealing with it\" 😒 stuck in cae need reFlight Booking Problems for next flight possibly dm for more info Has the most useless &amp; Rude employees ever at Philadelphia airport never again will I fly with them ! 😤 tell them to get on that, please. I really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved gate agents are now working with everyone to resolve connecting flight issues which is my concern 5534. That\\'s the flight I was placed on after original flight to Charlotte was Cancelled Flightled. Now 5534 is on 1hr delay 1st a reaccommodation, now a delayed flight for this one. &amp; the Gate Agent still hasn\\'t mumbled a word. Folks getting anxious. please don\\'t go to the check in process uses at #MCO. It\\'s an absolute disaster. how about a phone # to talk to a real person? over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. Had to rent a car and you still have not helped us I gave up I\\'ve been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way? lack of communication with other offices, the customer, &amp; yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers to be fucking up as badly as u do after last night in Charlotte NC I\\'m seriously debating never flying you again. 50 minute on the Tarmac, connection leaves. great but that still does not help me.. hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go why didn\\'t you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight #passengersLose I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after &gt;hour. my luggage was delayed. I\\'m looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it... stranded in cold Texas and getting sick because you overbooked the flight and gave my seat away. #gooutofbusiness Worst experience ever. Unable 2 help over phone and told at last min cabin crew unavailable for flight. Never again #USAirways Thanks. “@USAirways: Weather disruptions have caused some of our crew to run Late Flight. We\\'re sorry for the delay to your flight.” 325 minute delay - this is absurd. Feel free to provide credits... Fuck you not even on your dime and free tickets. #worsttraveldayever disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening. thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons. 25 mins after the scheduled departure and still sitting in terminal. Communication would be lovely... this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now! traveling with 2 year old. would appreciate you holding up your end of good business and hosting us in our unanticipated layover. missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail of course never again tho . Thanks for tweetin ur concern but not Doin anythin to fix what happened. I\\'ll choose wiser next time I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue. half an inch of snow in Charlotte #overwhelming Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number. already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers. your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again that link leads to a website that won\\'t open on a cell phone. Good job, shocking that your airline is folding. My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I\\'d be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact? No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I\\'ve landed but was suppose to land at 5 ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn\\'t make up for it my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She\\'s only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways 👿 she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them 5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . Is that even real life ? Get me off this plane , I wanna go home 👠👠👠 (3 heel clicks) flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don\\'t have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening? I\\'m sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful. hey let flight 1874get to the gate hours Late Flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board a flight update doesn\\'t help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?😑 Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..??? NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious I\\'m sure you don\\'t but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won\\'t come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks. not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded What will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail Your whole handling of this was a joke.Boston Logan had one little old lady,ONE handling all the customers on hold for 1:23. All because they won\\'t let me use a companion voucher online and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword No, they won\\'t because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn\\'t borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours... I\\'ve been sitting in the Charlotte airport for 4 hours. Waited for crew and now maintenance. #NeverAgain delayed my flight 3 times before Cancelled Flighting it, had angry and rude workers, and are now providing no helpful service at all My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight. Completely dissatisfied with Commitment to excellence is 2b praised. Can get you to the wrong city 2 days Late Flight or the right one 3 days Late Flight. #customerservice car services to and from the hotel, food, hotel cost bc of Cancelled Flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications I\\'m amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers. when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn\\'t care less beware, Barklays bank has terrible cust service. Will not assist, only know to go by badly written book(in English). they call weather an act of God and refuse to help. I have my wife and 3 kids and they have no sympathy. bad weather shouldn\\'t mean bad service stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff. flights keep getting delayed and Cancelled Flighted with no information, worst customer service ever. what does \"your reservation is \\'out of sync.\\'\" mean? On hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up sits on a throne of lies where\\'s my bag? You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises. I need that bag! flt 470 Tampa to CLT is very Late Flight gonna miss conn to BOS what can you do? I\\'m on the flight, finally in the air. Not enough food to feed customers. No movie or entertainment on a 5 hr flight. is the worst airline I’ve ever flown on. You guys have treated me like garbage today. Only water on flight 763 to DCA? This is the first time I\\'ve ever seen this happen. #ExecutivePlatinumMeansNothing #IWantCoffee I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true? I did, but it won\\'t help.. Can\\'t believe you wouldn\\'t take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits? 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous! been delayed three times now finally boarded. Been waiting 20 minutes. Now being told the plan has to be completely powered down. 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS. It\\'s like this is a joke to you. thanks to my trip is all screwed up. Ive had to move meetings and a dinner and im STILL not out of nyc yet i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!! freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday I was told there is no record of my refund. Can someone please help me. This has been a long day I tried speaking to multiple people at your reservations desk after 30 min on hold. #waivethefee #poorcustomerservice #Neptune Being put back on hold for what has now been an HOUR is completely unacceptable. Stop reposting same autoresponse That was return flight home #imateacher. Couldnt get to RSW #neptune#waivethefee #notmyfault contd.. They put her on 7 pm flite tonite. I think she\\'s on now. Worst customer service ever! U need to fix it. My Flight Booking Problems C68LD9 just times out when I select it under Manage My Flight Booking Problems for months now. I have emailed but no response. Help? UR service is so shitty. Pilot never showed up so we waited hours because another pilot was supposed to come but didn\\'t #Cancelled Flighted ticket couldnt be used bc unable to get to departing dest (RSW) bc of blizzard in BOS. Told only way to use credit is $200 fine if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry! 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes. flt 5302 CLT to DAY supposed to depart 5:51; the 6:20...still no crew. #schedule/contact the pilot! so i ask for ice and the attendant snaps \"i dont have ice on this cart\" not 5 min Late Flightr 2 cups of ice to the people 2 rows ahead.

What\\'s going on? extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy. robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. Just wow. said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that? Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff I\\'m not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place. can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM. Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks! I\\'d like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems. None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary. that doesn\\'t really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification... this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system. how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw? Waiting to be marshaled in You Cancelled Flight my flight and there’s no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc I\\'m frustrated by all of the attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service You\\'ve misunderstood. WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, \"NO.\" car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait what weather sun is out so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from I was told a few days over the phone - but it\\'s well past that. I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight. It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn\\'t care 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me? The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour. I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I\\'m now out of extra meds and diapers for baby. you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE! Fuck you. Not giving you a hard time...Just looking for basic customer service after AA lost my bag. ETA on it\\'s return, please???????? Can someone contact me about my awful experience with american airlines this weekend actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest. Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn\\'t involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours? the flight is not going to make the connection to #MEX #AA2444 1-the lavatory freezes, 2- problem with a nitrogen line 3-a low tire with the inflating equipment malfunctioning #AA2444 and... why did flight 1636 get Cancelled Flightled? Waiting for a rep to rebook, but wondering if there will be other issues getting out. we are going to the police dept due to the sexual assult that your stewardess allowed to occur and your lack of concern I am trying to change the time of a flight I already purchased and was told I have to pay a $400 change fee. Ridiculous. if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after since you don\\'t care about what happens to your passengers on your planes we will now be contacting the Police Dept why are gold forced to pay for an upgrade? Open seats in 1st and not offered to Gold/Sapphire It\\'s been 3 weeks and no reply from customer relations yet. Running out of time, please help. request: 1-2888155964 thanks Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don\\'t have a seat assignment? Seriously? if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!! why does it feel like I\\'m being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat Flight 2559 it\\'s been delayed every hour since 8:55 am. Can\\'t unload flight #3322 because jetway is broken. #steps #planB? #waiting nearly an hour I\\'d love to take my seat, but it appears as though someone already has. #disappointed #upgrademe #wtf just look at RDU airport. please think about the safety of your passengers. we cant get to RDU safely! Please explain why it costs almost the same price of a full roundtrip fair to only change the departure time of a flight? The flight was delayed 5 times. Spent almost 40min on the tarmac. I\\'ll reconsider my future flight options. Filled out a baggage claim over the phone last night. Check the status to discover the rep confused Arkansas for Alaska 😒 I need an answer why we can\\'t get into Wichita Falls. #AmericanAirlines says most bags left in Miami have been returned following mechanical glitch &gt;&gt; I need refund. really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals. #americandairlinesSUCKS why is raleigh not on the updated southern states advisory??? hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found and it\\'s not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It\\'s A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay stop sending me back to \"customer relations \"I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!! Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day Can you tell me what that means? I work and just need an estimated time of arrival please? I need my laptop for work. Thanks Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW? Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact we negotiate w/companies forU! I guess that is your way of saying thanks for sharing but I can\\'t help you, Good Luck. Happy Birthday to me. Ugh Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length. The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks. Yes I am. 2495/1170. RNO departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at DFW to LGA. I can do the 1120am to LAX and then to JFK How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation? Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO. guess that\\'s what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don\\'t have other options JS thanks for finally letting me get through to book my flight. Frustration set in... #donedeal #talktoahuman I guess I was one of the select few that hadn\\'t had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength “@AmericanAir: Have you reached out to for help, David?” the communications seems to be an issue too, no? now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another??? DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937 Hello...My baggage has been lost in another city. Can anyone help me with this? sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can\\'t find a tool to service the shock absorber. I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should’ve taken diff route or airline I suppose! Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I\\'m betting this will go 6 mths but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance? No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home. 4285. Apparently we’re told, staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don’t. over 70 days no contact from a human or apology letter. is #yucki. Read all about it soon Well I\\'m showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed? My ticket was booked with AA with miles..... Sorry we sold you a ticket with a company we merged with but we can\\'t fix it? Is it possible to change the FF number on a passenger on a Flight Booking Problems, it won\\'t let me change it? here. feet are freezing b/c doors have been open. Flt time was 8:30. We have fuel but now waiting for \"rampers\" #AA4285 Just got a call from baggage dept. \"...still looking for your property\". It\\'s went missing 1/28. PRERECORDED NO HUMAN SERVICE!! there is a fat man stuck in your airplanes bathroom what\\'s the status of flight 3494 XNA to DFW. I\\'m getting different reports? I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land. the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane? The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams. If the flight I selected online was what was ticketed I would not be missing my connection. I need help getting to DFW or IAH!! my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane? US Air 597 jfk to phx I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on... once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance? no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. \"We will take off soon.\" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW. I\\'ll be sticking with in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service. there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible. ...2/2 doesn\\'t help me. As I already have a booked flight that I can\\'t use &amp; can\\'t change w/o a $200 fee, Flight Booking Problems a different type of ticket...1/2 an overzealous stewardess prevented us from bringing in a car seat! #worstflight! watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn\\'t leaving till 1220 how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do? Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. has always been accommodating. flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I\\'m hungry! Get me to DFW! your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight. when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft.. don\\'t merge with an airline that ain\\'t ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #NotHappy #NeedCoffee “@AmericanAir: Good morning, Tamara. We\\'ll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.”#NoXTraLegRoom #NoCoatCloset how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated #Boo! Wack ass terminal 6 No food. No lounge. No Bueno!! Never again!!! You sent me a cheque today which can’t be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying! The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again. Unknowledgeable staff. I’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to? zoom in on the sauce and potatoes. This stuff is vile. And I mean vile. - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I\\'ve flown almost all of them when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route? 2 hour flight, could use some love! What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better. I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane She seems a little preoccupied - that\\'s why I\\'m bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer. She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside. Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts \"why this person was talking to her\". yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still \"Now Boarding\"... stated before I\\'m not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site. but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform. as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated. again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i\\'m on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding. 140 characters aren\\'t enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are your cabin \\'thank you\\' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time. really? That\\'s it? Not even a \"we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time\" Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401 She told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. Really? Don\\'t have time to do that. #terrible The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people having trouble Flight Booking Problems a seat on US84 11 March, operated by AA. Neither airline\\'s website will allow seat selection? thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance. I fly weekly with you and haven\\'t seen one I would love to say the same but it\\'s not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll Uwon\\'t allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service? Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction. Horrible service Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn\\'t help at all. That’s a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn’t understand e-mail 101. Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful? If you are sorry, answer my claims (AA Ref#1-2990176298, 1-3001885409 and : 1-3001885409) accordingly, without using \"weather\" she has the guy u served drinks 2 til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women there\\'s a lot of talks and no doing. MIA-SFO on a 20+ year old plane #nonewplanes #old #shame Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future ! are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you! especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...Thanks fortunately the window seat was a no-show. Able to scoot over and create space. so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what? this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull! just need to know why it wasn\\'t done like it was promised it would yesterday too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should\\'ve bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you. So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges? 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline. I\\'m flying into DCA my bag is at IAD. I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work. I will call the number when I land 😭 face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can\\'t do...... just wow Regina just told me I can\\'t file or request a lost bag statement until I finish my travel. So until I get to DC argg I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA\\'s response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!! You should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite, condescending platitudes.... is non existent and I will take this as far as needed.Why hide behind a corporate logo? Provide a number #tcf #useless #amateur LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from... it isn\\'t good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I\\'m still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX what\\'s the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in. would have been had I seen this before 1130pm EST, when I was sound asleep. merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not? needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. People need to catch their flights! I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances. the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing. Just wow oh no she left the counter and went downstairs. Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter. Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead. you really need some customer service training for your unhappy EEs in the morning in Chicago. Gate K20 at 430 chking her schd .@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue. .@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded... I\\'m trying to choose my seats but every time I go to the next flight I get system error Policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation. Flying is not for... leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling. I\\'ve been trying to change a Thursday flight and there\\'s a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn\\'t helping We all did! Skipper\\'s walk-around too :( Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn\\'t work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system. thanks for the canned reply. just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen?? no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled! I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there. I\\'ve emailed your customer service twice now who don\\'t seem to care. no I\\'ve since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost! nothing, you have done enough. I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection! gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!! I have emailed several times.hand wrote a letter,went to airport,called.please fix this! Or please help! offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you\\'re supposed to provide over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled. I\\'m done with you. another generic response guys? Cmon. You\\'re terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX I tried, EXTREMELY RUDE. Even the supervisor. And when I asked to speak to HIS supervisor I was told no yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp. worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude 😡😡 thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible.. I did twice.got a letter back saying that your company \"doesn\\'t issue refunds for phone bills\" help!phone will be shut off TY! But, their site says \" Please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for American Way. ...\" its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to\"arrange pick up\"in argentina,claiming tollfree: won\\'t reimburse me. Help! pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine. i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don\\'t like myself? I responded. Your info different than your customer service line will not help us on the phone, at the gate or in checkin. I book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain does not know the meaning of customer service. Nightmare. Paid for direct flight. Bumped to Dallas. Flight Cancelled Flighted. Terrible that\\'s absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can\\'t immediately call back when disconnected??? my flight was Cancelled Flightled I called they said they\\'d call back in 1:36. They did And hung up now saying I have to wait 2 hrs!! *does = doesn\\'t Okay... If someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. It\\'s a very small item. what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service! \"The wheel was broken when we got it. We swear.\" Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available??? I\\'ll give a reward for whoever finds and returns to me on Thurs when I fly back thru I ❤️ these earrings!! checked in at Des Moines, lay over in ORD, final destination Austin, Texas. Baggage was only checked to ORD. you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks after running from one flight, because we had 10 mins, to our next flight, we then sat on our plane for an hour. I understand that but I\\'m hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag. yeah, buy me a plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation. is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be. hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help? I DM\\'d you Why doesn\\'t provide a means for dialogue? What is the fear that drives this decision? #worstcustomerserviceever 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing. it\\'s not only my bag...it\\'s the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time. Why doesn\\'t allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service? #worstcustomerserviceever it\\'s not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. 👎😡✈️ #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm no, you should do something about everything happened yesterday... Thanks! Bleh, disconnected! Let\\'s try this again!! your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage. were stuck on a plane in Dallas that\\'s supposed to be going to Okc. There\\'s an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer? - thanks. She submitted a damaged bag complaint online...is there anything else we can do? #goodcustomerservice they responded. I can\\'t respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight? .@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I\\'d rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks! TSA. When I tried to check in the things I\\'ve bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back arrived +-10pm eastern. Had to deplane on the CRJs airstairs to an icy Tarmac. Valet bags sent to carousel, so it was 10:20pm. couldn\\'t get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won\\'t be on flt 1568 tomorrow. BS that #Noise #Late Flight #NoRahm It\\'s sad how I can\\'t afford any long distance trips though. :/ As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience that was the worst customer service experience ever. Too bad for you I\\'m a lawyer. Enjoy my wrath. it\\'s beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing. I look forward to hearing back and hope that my next trip will not be like this - you broke my sick wife\\'s luggage handle going from JFK to LAX...she had to drag her bag thru the airport! #customerservice no not yet. Waiting now to be connected to an agent when should i expect a response from customer relations glad that you WANTED to help me, but you didn\\'t. Have an agent call me before I rant about shitty service every day There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH 😁 your online site doesn\\'t have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done? #2298. Everyone else was outstanding. the last was 2339 dfw to ord. Not weather reLate Flightd... Austin leg delayed as well My bag flew with AA while I flew with Delta, and I\\'m still not sure whose final carrier is referred to. you have Cancelled Flightled my flights because of my last name. Do the right thing and reinstate my tickets flight veers off icy runway at Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Mon figures right? you know I love this airline, but why are my friends having such a problem retaining info they need $600 Late Flightr, 2 complete itinerary changes, and lost work and time, but yeah \"I\" got it rebooked you\\'ve got to be kidding. Look at the pictures. I\\'m hoping it\\'s on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much You\\'re clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I\\'d have missed funeral. Nice try I heard your crew whisper \"she\\'s still at the hotel, she probably doesn\\'t think she has to work until tomorrow\" I\\'m at the airport right now and your people didn\\'t know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated. So break whatever you want, take no responsibility..Too bad for customer? #media #filmcrew #nytimes flight veers off icy runway at Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Monday, Flightaware says. my mom tried also. That wasn\\'t the reason they wouldn\\'t change it. Y\\'all literally said that you\\'d rather have an empty seat. YOU FUCKING SUCK Is this a serious thread. Maybe you guys should re-read it. #fail now on 5th plane of the day. First 4 all taken out of svc. Scheduled dep 3 p.m. Still on ground ORD 10:45pm you are beyond redemption. Jfk. Baggage claim looks like a luggage warehouse even followed me, but I still can\\'t get them to answer their phones. Worst. Customer \"service\". Ever. #customerservice #fail yeah and what are they gunna? Nothing your whole organization is a joke My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why? Great, then tell me how you will fix it? #media #filmcrew #photography #cameragear 2hr and 20 min delayed...still waiting...you need to do something to improve... It says on you web site that u fly directly from ORD to DUB. when I try to book it says you do not. Have you stopped ? I booked it on US Airways site. Don\\'t see a Cancelled Flight link :( we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty Late Flight again geez flt2417 #Late Flight #delays #typical to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I\\'ll stick the Delta from now on. absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can\\'t even deliver it after I was told it would happen. what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable what is going on with the flight 2417? It has been delay a lot . We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere. which one.?i have been booked on 6 different ones in the past 2 days Nope. Couldn\\'t make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed. doesn\\'t care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can\\'t do anything. #media #filmcrew unable to access the website. Will try again. Best planes in the business. NOT? AA5411 today. I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable. thx for the apology. A commitment to fix your broken system would be better. Actually fixing it would be better still. seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child. this is the biggest joke I\\'ve ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have WHAT IS GOING ON? This is pathetic. Online doesn\\'t work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment. This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won\\'t let me select online and there\\'s a fee... on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen. so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys You found my lost luggage, won\\'t bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn\\'t nicer. Terrible service Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i\\'m deaf and been on hold so long? \"sorry you were disappointed\" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs It\\'s not allowing me to book available seats seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids. of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. Never ever ever again. #neveragain #aafail LITERALLY just told me they\\'d rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don\\'t think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting If it\\'s in my backpack, why do I need to see agent? I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u. Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn\\'t been released to inv. Help? 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes. Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money? After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules. help! Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn\\'t even try to help! the issue wasn\\'t a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn\\'t let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message. thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held. Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys. I\\'m here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag. obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I\\'m not. I\\'ve been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) if it I have not rebooked didn\\'t get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled Without notifying though? “@AmericanAir: We don\\'t like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us.\" how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money im still on hold... you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It\\'s because your airline sucks. Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?! #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal. #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL. SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort.. needs an entire customer service overhaul would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money? why do you continually play the \"according to federal regulations\" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service... thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport????? thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this? .@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action. need to be reported to the for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I\\'m disappointed. Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant. #customerexperience ok makes no sense tho Since you\\'ll give me a free upgrade to first. I didn\\'t want to Cancelled Flight, I wanted to take someone off and keep my price. Held at 402, at 10am today 440, now 530 it\\'s not about the delay. It\\'s about the communication. would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service? 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central. About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central. - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted - I\\'m pregnant with twins and you\\'re going to abandon me overnight in an airport? No hotel? When it\\'s your fault? has no idea what they\\'re doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION THE SAME TIME. have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back. why did you drop my call. Why don\\'t you have more people answering phones? Why is it always high call volume when I call I can\\'t work with them if the call gets cut off while I\\'m still holding..... Is DFW looking any better tomorrow? u didn\\'t give an answer why the flight delayed so long. and how do u compensate missing my other flights Lima to Cuzco?? yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee\\'s swapping your customers belongings? now I have to wait \"more than 60 minutes\" I need assistance reFlight Booking Problems a flight from dfw to lit Just took off. Sitting with someone who is scheduled on Buenos ares out of JFK,not sre if he will make it. R thy holding plane? .@AmericanAir No. I watched these bags be abandoned at depart gate. Watched for &gt;40 mins until owner returned, 20+ mins after I reported my Mistake multibillion dollar company why would it take that long? My credit card company says the card hasn\\'t been charged yet. Should it take 5 days for this? for our delays !!! I\\'m out of more money because of you I have got a flight for The next day !! What about a credit ! You guys are a multimillion dollar company give us back a Credit dont send me a tweet to cover your social media complaints. How about sending me a message with a way to resolve?!?! #CustServ what a joke you can mail The receipt !! Yet. We can\\'t mail Them A payment and fly before hand right No. It does.

Zero response from the tweet you last sent me. I tried site &amp; doesnt allow me. Same reason why I wasn\\'t allowed to board this morning. Will try diff airline for work trips I bought a plane ticket 2 months ago and still haven\\'t received my flight info and ticket in my email when it will come? your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA 2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account.

Thanks! you\\'re airline is ridiculous the group of minor children were broken up into groups. Some still in Miami. Delta has much better customer service! that\\'s the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed. My flight 1389 from Las Vegas to DFW was Cancelled Flightled! I\\'ve been on hold forever and I still have not spoken to anyone! Pls Help every time I try to call, it tells me to try again Late Flightr and just hangs up. rebooked into a different airport. Throwing a wrench into plans 👀 crew did the best they could but it was out of their control. You only get one chance of a honeymoon &amp; you failed miserably Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes overbooked business class from Mia to uvf - after being in the correct seat we were moved back to economy on our special day that\\'s unacceptable so what if I didn\\'t have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral I have to miss a whole days worth of work tomorrow but I\\'m suree you guys don\\'t care this is a big company should be happy to do something for a customer when now it\\'s costing more for delays oh and did I mention I have a ticket that has been pending for 4 days. Is it normal to take that long?? I want to make sure there isn\\'t a problem. and just bad cs! I will be back on at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble for my delay and you know what I get a we don\\'t credit anybody back a supervisor who cut me off when speaking a free check bag a food comp a flying credit something to help out now that I\\'m an additional 200 dollars in the hole yes I did but no response. my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW I\\'d just like to know where my bag is, when I\\'ll get it and why I don\\'t have it already. No accountability from Cust Service. I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates. Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag! it is absolutely unacceptable. I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help! - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family. Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week. It\\'s not about weather, it\\'s logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents? I\\'ve never had anything bad to say until now. No love for faithful customers. Also Agent not aware clearly of Additional fare cost $19.. Tix change price 195 UK Pounds ($304). $19 not the issue the 195 UK Pounds IS ! #badcustomerservice I fly American because of family but severe weather excuse so I can\\'t call to make change, why have a computer if u cant modify No Meelan did not afford a supervisor to be included in the conversation, pls check the rec of the call #badcustomerservice I had it until last night, but because \"severe weather\" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each. has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can\\'t go to funerals or see friends bc of it. what\\'s done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over. just messaged you. Please have someone contact us immediately. why can\\'t have the capability to spread salt on a runway?! 3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning. already spoke to that line, unwilling to help - really poor support #hitawall but seriously if my cats dead I\\'m going to be pissed/very thankful because it is evil and wants my soul not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr! I\\'ve tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it... day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn\\'t received anything but after no I will be calling corporate! cannot understand how you are part of oneworld all other member treat their customers fairly #tcf #oldplanes #damageluggage probs the worst customer service ever. Replied to complaint I submitted 6 weeks ago bout damaged bag... Not even replacing it! I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting! thanks! I hope we get movies. Tv\\'s were broke on the flight over thanks for being entirely unhelpful and wasting hours of my time today Well we won\\'t be flying you. Rebooked on Jetblue. With credits (that actually work) it was free! check on what? Our broken tablet! See attached picture. #media #filmcrew #nbc #cnn been calling all morning. Still can\\'t get through. I need to chge a flight that is this week!!!!! should prob give me a refund since they made me miss my flight waiting to talk to someone for 3 hours... oh I did. All I received back was an email saying \" delays happen\".. Uh huh.. How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don\\'t see any way to do that from my reservations page. Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane. yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing. why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho? stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating I understand they\\'re busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk HELP U said ud chnge our retrn flght since we missed our connection Sat &amp; now ur not pickng up the phone.Only hve 18 hrs left! has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it. bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model. how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS. instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out. I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn\\'t be bothered. my wife was on a flt from BRO to TUL via DFW that was Cancelled Flighted. Bought an SWA flight to get her home. Partial refund,DM me plz? I\\'ve been trying to get through to reservations since yesterday to make a change to a reservation hold, when will it be up? thanks - I miss my dog and this delay is costing me a lot of money. I still can\\'t get through to change my flight. This is really important plz help! I ended up emailing my #Complaint to customer.relations@aa.com, hope that works. #TravelProblems for tomorrow some sites show flight 1642 from ewr Cancelled Flightled, is it? can lie to you about where your lost bag is, but we are suppose to trust them with our lives thousands of feet in the air... Can\\'t help now as all seats have been taken. There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days. the worst first class boarding service I ever had. most disgusting chicken entree I\\'ve ever seen. Your standards have seriously nosedived. #NewAmerican im tryin to book a flight but cant get ahold of anyone! finally at final destination but not w/o extra significant travel expenses &amp; missed work. How can you resolve this experience? Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck! already shared with them. Nothing done! is better than AA. I really can\\'t there though to an agent, and I am worried about my reservation. Can you help me out! while listening to a delay message on my phone, another delay message was coming in. Get your shit together! Hi. Get error msg when trying to check in on line. States: wrong pass#. Tickets rcvd from AA due to training in DFW. U know Y? there\\'s an employee at gate 45 of JFK telling people their bag doesn\\'t fit and needs to be checked when it clearly fits #AA291 after waiting for a delayed plane, we sat on the plane for an hour waiting for a Late Flight passenger. That\\'s BS too.. WHERE IS MY BAG?!?!?! Not true!! Stop making excuses! You either overbook or have crappy planes! no. Booked seat in Dallas, live in Dallas. Real nice that your gate agent had exit row available told me they weren\\'t available I paid using Paypal online and after I was charged there was a \"System Error\" which is what I ended up calling about. that\\'s why I\\'m asking for exception. Staffer moving last minute,we\\'re a nonprofit &amp; losing $400,we just want to change ticket. your advantage agents are horrible! I\\'ve been waiting for 5 hours for a call back only to be hung up on by a rude agent! yes there\\'s issues on the site as well unfortunately. my wife is stuck in #Brownsville any chance she can get any flight out? She needs to be at work tomorrow morning. Will it be this year, do you think? the best is your 800 message saying to use website and your website is saying you need to call. If you don\\'t answer, #hardtodo Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I\\'m stuck AA1675 now that the airplane has been sitting here for over 24 hrs,there are mechanical problems.BTW,the AA desk is unorganized Miami-PhL flight Cancelled Flightled just as I got to the gate. No one from AA around, no one on the phone. Awful awful awful. Can care less if youre without your bags for a day or a week! Ive been 3 stories in the last 3 hours...I WANT MY BAG! hah, best flight attendant response, if you not happy getting screwed over, you have other carriers. hahahah pathetic AA1675 flight out of Jamaica was Cancelled Flightled yesterday due to \"weather\", while other flights were still landing at DFW your a LIAR, no precipitation all day, 47 degrees, don\\'t pacify, you look like a fool.......thats the problem, admit you suck 12 calls in the span of two days........none of which available to speak to someone. You are un F-in believable. worst ever I\\'m sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters! What\\'s with your baggage handlers calling out at DFW today? No luggage onboard the planes. .@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I\\'m not paying extra to select a seat. why can\\'t you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it\\'s customers? from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn\\'t make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant will not let me reuse my ticket. Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta! Never flying on American again...... now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now. she was rude, unprofessional, not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied! work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby. Hello, question, How many balloons do you think it will take to life up one of your planes? need2know if Ill be able to reach IND today.Rather stay in MAF that fly to DFW &amp; find out I can\\'t travel I\\'m trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim hi there flight from Dallas just Cancelled Flightled going to LA. Can u pls help rebook me? 2nd time in 4 days that my flight has been delayed and my gate agent hasn\\'t said anything! Thanks for the memories. #NeverAgain have been in call cue for 11 hours. No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours. Got a call but was hung up on. been on the phone for 47 minutes...said it would be 10... Any advice? I don\\'t believe it\\'s acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that\\'s standard. I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn\\'t allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address? our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call? here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn\\'t the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I\\'d be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation. This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left. #customerservice been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? We don\\'t mind the fee! We were told we can\\'t change name on ticket at all. the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn\\'t reflect the use of a voucher Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren\\'t able to accommodate. Thank you. After being patient about my \"delayed\" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable! I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service. flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event. Sent to three gates in the night Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive) Not okay. Since you couldn\\'t put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline. Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I\\'d have to take a 2nd day off work. been airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said \"we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch\"! I\\'ve tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST. I\\'m having no luck -help! Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour. You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday. Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows. unacceptable. It\\'s clear losing just one customer doesn\\'t matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take will do on another airline that\\'s more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply is there a way to reserve my dog’s flight without speaking with a representative? Just was booted from your helpline! I\\'ve been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler! Can you tell me where my luggage is? I was on flight 1644 SNA to DFW and my flight to MKE was Cancelled Flightled, so got rebooked to ORD it\\'s GTSVYB. It says it\\'s Cancelled Flightled when I try to check. That\\'s good, I\\'d expect that but I can\\'t get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online? ; US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions. hey ho its not me losing any money (only you) just next make sure you stick to the \"flyers right\\'s booklet\" Trying for 20 hrs to reach agent. Must make change that can\\'t be done on web by 11:59 PST. Had to Cancelled Flight revs ystday. Oh, and losing my luggage #ridiculous # angrybird # where\\'smybag please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You\\'re ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage. but don\\'t you worry... took good care of me... Your loss, their gain. sure is. What\\'s more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands. thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn\\'t. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam! 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry Your people on the phone can\\'t see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That\\'s a poor process then... still not taking calls ? Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob not helpful you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. 2 hours now! No I\\'m not patient. Why don\\'t you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold please do something about boarding at DCA 35X.

Really? Still doesn\\'t pick up status on US Air flight. worst experience ever. all the way! calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take \"18 hours\" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is \"the best we can\" it\\'s not about the weather. It\\'s about the fact that I can\\'t get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back. please message me for assistance - can\\'t get through to anyone.

They\\'re equivalent to DIRT!!!!!! pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight. # fire the software programmers I\\'m getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support? Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then? how can you have no food on a 4 hour flight 528 from Columbus to Phoenix? Starving and Pissed off. Can\\'t eat Go Go! jal and cathay pacific so no, I can\\'t do it online. 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks. The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened. my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one. Hey so I\\'m very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I\\'ve had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed! 37 minutes?????? having trouble getting rebooked I understand. I\\'m feeling cranky. I called AA\\'s bag tracker number and heard \"your bag has not been located.\" 😩 AA45 ... JFK to LAS. I\\'m willing to hold for an agent. you aren\\'t being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do? Need to go frm TPA to MCI tmrw &amp; my connection thru DFW is Cancelled Flightled. Can u connect me thru a diff city? Been on hold for 2 hrs Any hints to get through to and stay connected with you to rearrange weather reLate Flightd Cancelled Flights? Hours in now w/nothing. no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? WTW / grounds crew is here / hope you\\'re ready to cover my delay You can\\'t even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media. “@AmericanAir: \"Jason, you\\'ll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.” Nope! Hasn\\'t taken off yet, still! finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight. Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye. instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents. guys 5350 in dfw stuck at the gate for half an hour. Do we pull the slide or what? plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business Now you\\'ve Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You\\'re losing customers. People are furious. I finally got someone on the phone so no worries! it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn\\'t a recording w a 2 hour wait time! ok. Pilots are looking for agents - they jumped out / FLT 5350 #DFW / this is crazy no you\\'re not you\\'re trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you\\'re still selling seats on the day I\\'m trying 2 travel because you won\\'t get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can\\'t. Who exactly is you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class... You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We\\'re stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow? we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry.. we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn\\'t even tell us we could get on standby. they don\\'t even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying \"what\\'s the hury, the plane is not leaving delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight? would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA\\'s fault no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff and let FLT 2350 know I\\'m coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences. are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me. 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people. yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding. thanks for the call on my Cancelled Flightled flight, NOT! Flight Booking Problems me for Tues no good weather caused me 2 leave early on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable? waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... hey flight 5350 in dfw stuck at gate with no gate agent. Plane full of people missing connections. so we\\'ve now been driving across DFW for over 90mins. That\\'s half fucking way to Texarkana! #shouldhavedriven can you tell me why all flights from XNA 2 DFW are Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow morning already? pathetic service oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!! is the situation at JFK this evening is going to get better or worse ? Do not Cancelled Flight a flight like yesterday after 8h delayed ya but u weren\\'t sitting on the plane. I know you can\\'t control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won\\'t pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad several hrs Late Flight and 140 characters won\\'t do it. Cheers though my wife\\'s flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable. If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it\\'s been 3hrs please help. we\\'re on AA1401 landed at 8:55pm in Miami, but waiting for a gate. Can someone on your team help us out?! - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min??? is there only one call centre? I know it\\'s busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can\\'t do it online #yourphonesystemsucks we\\'ve been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!! their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!! -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of \"weather\" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice. my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do? \"We\\'ll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight\" is ridiculous. You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning! seriously, you hate since they can\\'t accommodate you due to inclemental weather disruptions? lol, very funny gotta be worse than w/ on time departures. I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven\\'t strtd boarding. In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can\\'t reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do? was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they\\'re not and I continue to be lied to. won\\'t answer the reservation line! Nice service. We may be stuck... It\\'s not your agents; it\\'s your voice activated system that\\'s not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won\\'t be better for flight 750. thanks no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don\\'t see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven\\'t even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked Every last leg back to US says invalid So plot thickens. We\\'re on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers.... 800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can\\'t talk to humans. what happened?? We didn\\'t get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone , to my surprise BA doesn\\'t have me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ? Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help? aa223 being ignored FYI twice now I\\'ve tried the \"we\\'ll call you when someone is free\" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up. that\\'s the number I called -it wouldn\\'t let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can\\'t figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed. I didn\\'t miss my flight. American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault. I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane 😢😕😦 #AmericanAirlines is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand I\\'ve never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline. you Cancelled Flightled my wife\\'s flight and she has to call but your service won\\'t even let us. Going on 7 hours now. it shouldn\\'t happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These issues are based on negligence. the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet. so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we\\'ll have heard from an AA rep at that point. on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful 😳 seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in I have followed and dm\\'d you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service. To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am. I don\\'t like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr. CS sucks. just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams. approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight. makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives? Very poor. how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293 I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on for $382 but their mileage program sucks. Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293 never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It\\'s on us air, so I don\\'t think I\\'ll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks. my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can\\'t get an agent. They\\'ve called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help? My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect? anxious to see how you all care for customers you’ve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy. Why can\\'t you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick \"Goodbye\" Very Sad! VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help! already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back. you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives? yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though 😒 I\\'m really mad about the situation whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won\\'t stray anymore. I\\'m talking about you between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer... I need help with a reservation purchased on but operated on can\\'t get through on the 800# flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. What do I do next? Pls advise. #HELP how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight! my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund? I can\\'t choose a seat online because I booked on ??? #SMH it wasn\\'t really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot. Makes a person paranoid. \"overweight\" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let\\'s call it what it is. at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF? Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled. Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I\\'d like to book another flight...I\\'ve been on hold for 95 minutes and counting.... been waiting on hold for more than an hour thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won\\'t be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning. spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least. well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible! see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing! this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can\\'t staff a call center Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven\\'t even seen one plane😡 AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal! a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on! The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles. we have 3 more passengers with me There are two more reservation numbers no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs \"here for you\" as in, yeah, we\\'ll tweet platitudes at you so you\\'ll think our Twitter bot cares? Or.... #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded. You have the worst customer service of any airlines I\\'ve ever encountered. Flat out awful why don\\'t you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you\\'ve got Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I\\'ve landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this. delivered mom\\'s delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight. Can we just leave now w/o the food won\\'t eat anyway? this is awful customer service. its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired translation: we don\\'t reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. \\'Cause we don\\'t care. OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally! no, you couldn\\'t care less. That\\'s why their customer service is run by bots pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home! yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would\\'ve cost me $30 extra per seat. we need a miracle please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning! finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps c17 CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure? Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare. I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook? i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me? Close down AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers\\' bags. I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again. you know nothing about customer service and I\\'ll make sure everyone knows it I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable. now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight yeah that\\'s not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped. I did 50 times and no one was helpful I\\'m missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn\\'t want to talk us My flight to was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key GRU) for sorting it out! I haven\\'t been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven\\'t heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :( not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting.... I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI is taking. I know it\\'s US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home. Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days.. Same as yesterday\\'s Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful! big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here. Thanks again for a sleepless night. really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and are useles Hi AA friends! My sis\\'s flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options? is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg? I have not. There\\'s no option for even getting a call back! tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool. all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I\\'m stranded at the airport for the night... wow. how hard is it to have catering ready to go? Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option? this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day. I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz. flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we\\'re not boarding because we\\'re waiting for catering? my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again. agents refuse to help, \"too busy\" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight? Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck ah if only we could get through. We\\'ve tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced. of course it wasn\\'t your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help! pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call. understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel? AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive I\\'ve been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me. rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer. you put a sour taste on this customer’s vacation. it was joke watching those “we care thanks for choosing us” videos help us here !!! We are stuck here for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I\\'ll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr. Flight AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say... here we go again #aa106 \"Plane not ready\". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded why does your customer service line say \"we are experiencing high call volume\" and then spontaneously hangup on the person? well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up try paying overtime and bring in more people pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :( any idea what\\'s up with flight AA3181? your maint delay left us stuck in den!! Flight 1080. Been on plane for 7 hrs. Stop flying broke french planes! sucks!! Teco teco #reclameaqui #TripAdvisor You can\\'t get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don\\'t I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago? ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home we\\'re still here guys - you are the worst 24 hours on the AirPort - don\\'t understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :( ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I\\'ve been in YYZ since 5 AM. plane breaks, unloads the passengers, told to re enter to only come back off.

Trip cut 7 hrs short due to flight change/massive layovers/ no peanuts or crackers/ asked for H2O and received about 2oz. Flight\\'s Cancelled Flightled. Website says to call phone number.Phone says to check online. How am I supposed to get some help? yes. We spent the whole day talking to agents and someone finally offered to let him stay in a hotel flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won\\'t give luggage back. Nice. delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... 😒 not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone. Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL. we did for the last 8 hours. Your customer service is horrendous. I should have flown Delta there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport. AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him \"I understand English.\" His reply?\"Our conversation is over.\" long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it\\'s winter! staff better AA 1657 was also over an hour Late Flight to depart Ohare and now we have no luggage. Not happy standing in a long line at baggage svc is flight 2934 dfw to gsp going to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow? Stuck on the plane in Charlotte. Going to miss my connection. No words from staff.

What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed? please pray for us that our gear is not lost or stolen due to YOUR incompetent employees. #CNN #ABCNews #MSNBC #Photography ...is this how you want to treat your platinum (and two gold) flyers??

Terrible experience here from start to finish Still sitting in airport as 6:05 flt delayed until 6:55...but still not boarding, what is happening? No info.... no gate agent, and only 3 PA updates for 3 hours, hinted at abandonment. horrible experience for all passengers. been a very long day in Philly...12:13pm flt to ORD Cancelled Flighted with NO notice, no message, no email. NOT NICE FOR WE PLATINUMS. my travel for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled and then stupidly rebooked for tomorrow! I can\\'t get through to reservations! 1416 Cancelled Flightled?

United needs our ticket number since you rebooked us and you gave the incorrect ticket number now we can\\'t check in #help #nothelpful MT Our call volume is extremely high today. Our apologies. Please continue contacting Reservations for assistance. I\\'ve been trying to call to cxl a reservation for tomorrow, due to needing surgery this week - cannot get through? I can\\'t keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue? I\\'ve called that and they said they can\\'t help me and it\\'s out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again! Stuck on a plane at JFK: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. Good job, AA! no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines while I\\'m aggravated - shouldn\\'t baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped? never fails to disappoint. waiting at jfk an hour after scheduled take off and still no word on departure one of my luggage didn\\'t made it onto my flight, hope it really gets here tomorrow, as I was told 😓😭 lost my wife\\'s luggage and nobody gives you and answer, all they say is go here or call there. why don\\'t you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on with no penalty or hoops. a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely. You\\'ve now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go. flight 1081 from IAD to LAX sat for more than 3hrs because ground crew couldn\\'t drive in snow #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH? As am I, - but thankfully there was a lounge next door. Really not impressed by oneworld partnerships :( delayed.....wow My flt AA375 for 02/23 got cncled and i cant get hold of a CSR so i can get alternate arrangement. Plz help our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn\\'t give them accurate ticket number now we can\\'t check in. #annoyed You guys are totally losing me. I\\'ve been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad. AA1224: 45 mins for Priority bags to arrive, now Late Flight for evening plans! Delta 20 min bag guarantee anyone? :( sitting in a 2 hour long at least phone queue. Hoping I get things rebooked in time or at least some plastic wings. #tears it\\'s always better to find out equipment is INOP on the ground than in the air! #safetyfirst is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head 11 out of 11 delayed flights, you suck and getting worse Tired of sitting on a delayed #1702 again and again computer down Two hour wait for EXPs as I sit on a JFK PHX flight because US computers are down. Any shot at an LAX flight? AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn\\'t even accepting calls right now - they just hang up. yes, and rebooked incorrectly. fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it\\'s the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me even with calls you haven\\'t been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn\\'t notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can\\'t get through to an agent. Epic. Fail. i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she\\'s prob stressed, but I am too! An \"aw, let me help\" cld mk it btr while I\\'m sensitive to this fact, I don\\'t believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way. I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff complt incompetence on flt 295.Lav delay from a pln that lnded last nite, no internet and poor svc. Not what I expect from u. why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing five times at last count as usual my next flight shows on time but it\\'s suppose to leave in 5 minutes and hasn\\'t boarded 250 I\\'m not sure if I\\'m rebooked now. In a line at airport trying to work it out. The earlier I can get to SFO the better:( Orbitz has only shown \"priority\" seats since we booked &amp; paid 3 weeks ago. has Cancelled Flighted their last 3 flight into SHV tonight &amp; all flights for tomorrow, Feb. 23, out of SHV and multiple flight into SHV. this might look good but the pita is inedible. Last year delicious shrimp cocktail. This year garbage that\\'s if it is ever complete and if i can ever get through customer service #theydontanswer Where are your tickets offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use vouchers on website, what a headache. PLEASE HELP! not sure what this means but son and I will certainly have operational needs for seats during Flt. 1679 next Friday, yet... Any updates? It shouldn\\'t take hours for assistance. I love I\\'ve flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers. You went from first to worst Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? served me rubber pasta covered In sauce that tastes like plastic. Do you have any food for human consumption anymore ? why do #exp members have to wait \"over 2 hours\" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake? u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!! #not cool #hateful No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything\\'s gr8 u cant spell airline and I trusted you to get me home on time and safe you are the worst #gobankrupt TY Can you confirm or deny if AA953 left JFK? I want to figure out if more delays are in store. Internet giving different info. Where are your ticket offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use voucher on website, what a headache! PLEASE HELP! I changed my own flight to tonight. Why couldn\\'t AA do that on my behalf instead of a flight tomorrow? Poor effort all around. she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service. third you lost her bag &amp; after 50 mins of being on hold you told her she would \"eventually get her bag\" completely unacceptable second, she sat on the Tarmac for 3 hrs only to be told it would be 30 mins there\\'s a direct from Miami w a seat but u rebooked niece Tuesday. Can\\'t get through on phones? #customerservicefail you have such a confusing web site/complicated ordering process. This is why I typically fly first my sister had ZERO food in her cross country flight with no type of warning or voucher I need to change a ticket and my res can\\'t be changed online. I also can\\'t get a call through due to high volume--can u help? rented van drove 250 miles with 6 strangers. Arrived home 6:00am. No offers of help from AA. the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16) Do you guys teach poor customer service or is it just part of an american dream? 3231DTW to LAG at 4:45. Flight Cancelled Flightled with no notice. Given a voucher to a dirty hotel, with no food vouchers or apology. No one answers phone, delayed/Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. You only get (I\\'m sorry, we apologize) blah blah blah. Bad Reservation Line won\\'t let me speak to a representative because they are too busy. They literally disconnect you. Why bother?

Dear American, when did 2 hour hold times become the industry standard? Have you heard of additional staffing during weather? .@AmericanAir: the best the agent could do is put me on a flight arriving tomorrow afternoon, with a six hour layover. that\\'s unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves. I let a crew member know every time this happens. Which is most of the time. are you kidding me? No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait. Brutal LGA 2 Nashville Cancelled Flightled phone center no help.

I was flying from Ft Lauderdale FL to Seattle WA on the 02/28/2015 until the 03/03/2015 and they don\\'t want to honor my flight. wasn\\'t able to get on hold. Your system kept kicking me to the main menu. Seattle check-in. 1 desk servicing full service line. 2 desks servicing priority. Full srvc wait 30+ minutes. Customer svc fail hey! Tried calling customer service and was told there\\'s a 2 hour wait. This has been for the past 4 hours. Thanks! You suck! since we are leaving tomorrow to miami can you do one thing right and deliver the bags to the airport? but have been yet to receive assistance from one of your agents in securing a new connection. Many will now miss work tomorrow. So you\\'re saying the call center is understaffed? Are you out of your mind, AA? What is the point of this Twitter acct? Form letters in 140 characters or less? many have missed connections already b/c of delayed flight which will finally board soon I wasn\\'t important this morning when you would not seat my wife and I together or allow me to choose seats at Flight Booking Problems!! i dont believe it, it has been impossible for your agents to get an update from the delivery company since yesterday at 11 am yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight. The personal touch you\\'re known for, AA. Other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. And 3 hr hold times. been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket. I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops. ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold. Not feeling confident that I will ever get through... bought a ticket on After two days, your \"team\" couldn\\'t share the data needed to get me to my next meeting. thanks for the response. I know it\\'s not your fault... But Im in ORD in T5 and hungry if you want to stop by ✈️✌️ cut it. Put me on a flt tomorrow. nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations I have no transportation to and going to some other city and getting to NY sometime on Wed?!

Been almost 24 hrs and hundreds at jfk upset, tired and want to get to BA. more of the insane treatment by your customers Help! I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held. No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It\\'s a small airport, so whatever. is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn\\'t work because... missing a full days of work thanks guys Trying to find out if flight #340 DFW to HOU is on tonight. Exec platinum desk not calling back and online info not clear. .@AmericanAir I can\\'t even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us. Flight Cancelled Flighted and rebooked but agent made a mistake and booked wrong date! Been trying to get through via phone for hours!! No, American. This is simple. How about YOU call HER back with the info for her new flight. Basic customer service I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow. Cool, a canned response. Nah, I think I\\'ll keep tweeting at everyone who mentions AA on Twitter. You could DM me, though. please fix your mobile and desktop site to allow Canadians to select a passenger when checking in. Thanks. tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I\\'m supposed to be leaving in an hour... .@AmericanAir cover a rental car or refund our ticket? - I\\'ll gladly drive 10 hrs home than be stuck here till Tues! should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket! You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket. I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops. If weather is bad, wouldn\\'t your folks try extra hard to communicate...or load bags onto flight 1320...or...anything? and how is this not a mechanical issue? All evidence points to the idea that it’s the ILS at CLL at fault, not the weather. Sorry in, like, a general way? Or sorry that incompetence/understaffing is compounding weather issues? Too bad there\\'s only, like, 3 people on that team, then. Because this is next level unreal. How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work. fix the engine of flight AA3031so I don\\'t spend all night in your airport so I can fly home tomorrow Just make sure they remember to load the bags onto the plane. They Cancelled Flight the flight when they forget... Is this real life, AA? Like, 2015 real life?

Didn\\'t get name. She was awesome! #twitterhug #shesaidrun I know. After an hour I got a live person. It messes up our arrival and car plans at two airports and is costing us more. i was also told by agents my issues \"aren\\'t their prob\" K fine. I get it. But have some compassion 4 others dealing w/this!!! What\\'s the status at DFW? Ticket agent at gate A9 was very rude and unhelpful. i was spoken 2 like I\\'m an idiot and that is not OK!! I don\\'t need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I\\'ve had I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious. I am NOT happy nor will I EVR fly w/ u again. When I left Orlando, I was 2nd in line for standby. I land and I\\'m 4th. \\'Priority members get first available seats\\'. Awesome. You didn\\'t respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you\\'re telling everyone else. I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can\\'t have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn\\'t resolve anything! don\\'t you guys have an email address?

I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It\\'s a good scam, but a scam all the same. I’ll play it by ear. I know that you are doing your best. Buy some chewey oatmeal cookies for your customer care folks. I\\'ve been trying for 4 hours to get hold of someone. what are my chances of making a connection to El Paso (AA504) with DFW from SAT (AA200) delayed 30 minutes? beyond frustrated with no call back from auto hold or whatever you call it. Entered my number at 11:30 CST, still no call 2:26 ahhhh your silence is golden now. This tops it all. Anyone get fired? Hey AA - can you help with an itinerary for a plat custy? Stuck in PVR and phones aren\\'t working Where\\'s my DM? Where\\'s my voucher? Who\\'s paying my $70 cab and my $50 car back to JFK tomorrow? we\\'ve been on hold for hours. Do you dislike delays when they\\'re caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end? It\\'s not the weather. It\\'s also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don\\'t duck truth. .....and they waited 5 hours in a stuffy plane until they could get off then 7 more hrs to get their luggage #AmericanAirlines my flight out of TYR tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted due to weather.
